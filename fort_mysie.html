    		Fort Mysie is a settlement of around 600 fishermen in the far northern Wendovia. The founders of Fort Mysie are various families and individuals from other more southern settlements in Wendovia, most notably The Colony. The climate of Fort Mysie is arctic. The temperatures average ~30 degrees F in the summer and -25 in the winter. Along with the incredibly cold climate, there is polar night for half the year and a sort of wet and dry season. There is almost no snowfall in the summer but incredibly powerful winds accompanying up to 300 inches of snowfall.

    	<h2>History</h2>
    	<hr class="style1">
    	<p>
			In 368 an explorer named Jon B. and a his group of around 6 other hunters set out north to hunt Great Northern Yak when they stumbled on what is today known as Lac Lamor. When they reached the lake they noted the tall mountains that lay around 100 miles to the north with Mount Kay being abnormally south and on its own. They also mention the Darkwood forests around the lake to the west and south. They began building a fortress on Cauldron, the 38th of Papa 370 and completed with a boarding house (which would later become the King and Candle tavern/inn), a single dock (now destroyed), and a basic log wall.
		</p>
		<p>
			On Farthing, the 11th of Re, 371 they loaded up the Tusked Trout they had fished out of Lac Lamor. According to a companion named William, they had nearly 200 pounds. They set out and arrived back at the colony 6 weeks later. 7 families then volunteered to follow them back to the settlement as the oil from the fish organs burned in their lanterns without any soot and it was sold almost immediately. For the next few winters, the men would leave for the settlement in late spring, fish for the whole summer, and head back in early fall before the winter came.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the course of the next decade, more and more families spent their summers at the fort and in 386, the fort had around 300 people and they chose to name it and stay the winter. currently around 40 people stay the winter.
		</p>
		<h2>Government/Society</h2>
		<hr class="style1">
		<p>
			Fory Mysie is only inhabited by the majority of its population during the summer as the winters are brutally cold and blizzardous. To deal with the two very different environments, the populous and economically prosperous summers along with the desolate and economically dead winters, the town laws and government structure operate under 2 distinct models used during the different times of the year. From <a href="date+and_time">Ci to the end of Ze</a> the Summer Charter is in effect, while for the remainder of the year the Winter Charter is in effect.
		</p>
		<h3>The Charters</h3>
		<p>
			The Summer Charter was the original charter for the town, it arose from the agreements of the first few groups of fisherman made about how they were going to conduct their business. A council of 6 meets every new moon to discuss matters of business such as storms, construction of new businesses, reinforcement of the wall, mapping, etc. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The Winter Charter was developed after the first few years of residents staying the winter. It is incredbily strict and only contrasts the Summer Charter is a few aspects. Its main focus is on dealing with the harsh winter. Example rulings include: No fishing is allowed to be performed, no one is allowed to leave the walls of the fortress at night, guards stand inside the walls, no one can wander no farther than visibility of the fortress during the day, housing and food are provided to all that reside in fort as well as any that stumble upon it. There is also a strict curfew of sunset, one must remain in the building you are in when the sun goes down. The town is run by 3 council members whose only job is assuring that food and supplies are distributed evenly. The fires in the boarding house and food storage building burn continuously.
