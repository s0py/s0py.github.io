									I'm no economist, but i think i could totally do taxes. Stock trades are now taxed, inheritence is taxed at a rate of that is a progressive percentage starting at 100,000 (10%) and ending at 100,000,000+ (90%) , people making min wage are not taxed (along with this, anyone paid over min wage for a min wage job has the corporate part of their taxes reduced by 110% of the value over min wage paid), progressive tax rates then up to 60%, no taxes on anything gained outside the planet earth on planets devoid of life up until 2100-01-01, carbon tax of 1800%. The carbon tax pays for the conversion over to a Green economy and the maintainence and repair of the bioregions of the US. The income tax is spread out over Education, NASA, the CDC, employment offices, election campaign money, and gov salaries. An 600% car tax will be spent on converting America to public transportation.

									Prisons are no longer privately operated in any way. Anyone whose sentence was for a crime that is no longer a crime is released. Voting is allowed for everyone inclduing those in jail, the death penalty is banned, life sentences are banned, prison is no longer punishment, it's a facility to help those who can't help themselves to function and live a better life in the world. Drug use is no longer a criminal charge, it's treated as self harm and is consuled.
									<li><h2>Circumcision</h2></li><br>
									Genital Mutilation will be treated as such no matter whose genitals are being mutilated. All forms of Genital Mutilation will be a crime punishable by a revoking of ones medical license, and a court decided sentence.
