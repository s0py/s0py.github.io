			<td><p>Polls compiled by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/">FiveThirtyEight</a> and analysis done by me. </p>

			<p>The analysis is a beta distribution where the two parameters are how many wins Biden or Trump got in polls. The wins are 	weighted by how long ago they were (half life of 2 weeks), what the sample was (adults, registered voters, likely voters), and sample size. this analysis includes every Trump v. Biden poll going back to June 1.</p>

			<p>
				Each of the bars represents the relative likelihood that that percentage is the chance Biden will win the election. This method assumes that things are up to chance and tries to estimate the most likely chance not the chance itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The intutition of this graph</b> is this: the idea that Biden has a 70% chance of winning is represented by the bar above 70%. It's size relative to the bar at 50% tells you how much more or less likely that idea of being true is.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Something important is that in the case of the poll being a tie, it is counted as a win for Biden. This is true for the state-level polls as well.

	<h1>How About the Electoral College?</h1>
	<h3>The Chance Trump Wins the Electoral College is</h3> 
    <h1><div style="background: #ffcc00; color: #000; padding: 5px; max-width: 60pt;">81%</div></h1>
	<h3>Here's the Relative Likelihood of each vote total in the Electoral College</h3>
	<img src="electoral college 2024-06-10.png" width="50%">s
	<p>
		There are only a few states that matter. These 8 are the ones that had the closest vote totals in 2020. This method assumes that all the other states will go the way they did in 2020.
	</p>
	<p>
		Biden and Trump are "given" a certain amount of electoral votes. This is the number of electoral votes from states that voted for them last time, <em>minus</em> the 8 states listed here. For Biden this is 231, and for Trump it's 189.
	</p>
	<p>
		To calculate the probability of which way the electoral college will go, we look at every possible combination of thes 8 states voting for either candidate. There are 2^8 of them, because for each state there are 2 ways it can go (Biden or Trump). We then can calculate the likelihood of the state voting that way given the data we have (the same analysis as is done for the popular vote). Once that it done, we can add up the likelihoods of each of the combinations that Trump wins and report the chance that Trump wins the electoral vote.

	<h3>Prediction of Popular Vote Share</h3>
	<p>The height of the curve shows how likely that candidate is to get that percentage of the popular vote. Blue is Biden and Red is Trump. The vertical lines show the highest point on the respective curvse. For some days, the lines are at the same place, so it will appear as if there is only one.</p>
