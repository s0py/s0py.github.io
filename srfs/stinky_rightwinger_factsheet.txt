First of all, while Japan’s Diet [Parliament] was, in theory, based upon an “open” multi-party parliamentary system, in practice, it acquired a centralized “Byzantine-like” nature based upon a party-political “machine”, i.e. the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that was essentially unresponsive to changing or competing interests and changes in the composition of interest groups. The desire of LDP “beneficiaries” — such as the Japanese nuclear-industrial complex — were facilitated by governmental organizations with which they were closely linked. What occurred in Japan, therefore, was that the centralized government agencies regulating nuclear power, MITI and NSC (Nuclear Safety Commission), simply collaborated on safety issues to the benefit of the Japanese nuclear-industrial complex. Secondly, in Japan, not only were the parliamentary and regulatory structures centralized, but the nature of the domestic power interests — industries and utilities — was also monolithic and uncompetitive."""

(Over the same period, there were also 17 populist governments that cannot easily be classified as either right- or left-wing; again, five of these governments diminished civil liberties and political rights.) Although this indicates a slightly higher rate of backsliding among right-wing populists than left-wing ones (38 per cent vs. 33 per cent), these data clearly contradict the belief that left-wing populism does not pose a threat to democracy."""

In Switzerland (1974), where compulsory voting was only partially abolished, it fell from 53.2% in 1967 to 43.6% in 1975 (and to a historic low of 34.9% in 1999). In the only canton where voting remained compulsory, turnout is up to 20% higher than in the others (IDEA, 2004, 26–29). In the Philippines (from 1972 until 1987) turnout rose from 53.5% in 1967 to 78.6% in 1978 and fell from 78.2 per cent in 1987 to 65.3 in 1992 (and 64.8% in 2001).

Before 1986, turnout nowhere deviated much from the average of 95.2% of registered citizens. It rose from 91.6% in 1980 to almost 95% in 1986 in regions retaining compulsory voting and dropped to 85% in regions abolishing it."""

Although this method tends to overestimate turnout in voluntary voting (would-be abstainers are more likely not to respond at all), results show that abolishing compulsory voting would probably lead to a decline of about 30% in countries like Australia (Jackman, 2001, 16316) and Belgium (Hooghe and Pelleriaux, 1998, 420–421)."""

# libertarian objections: freedom to stay at home

This argument functions as some kind of rock-bottom: I oppose compulsory voting because it infringes on my freedom by which I may well prefer to stay at home. One can doubt whether the resistance of opponents who prefer to stay at home is really based on libertarian conscientious objections. Against those who abstain because of pragmatic considerations, one can argue that attending the polling station every two or three years is not too much to ask, especially compared to governmental obligations such as compulsory education and tax duties, which are much more time-consuming (Keaney and Rogers, 2006, 7, 30, 35).

Take, for example, the study that is probably the nation’s only truly real-world political advertising field experiment. During Rick Perry’s 2006 re-election campaign for Texas governor, a team of researchers convinced Perry’s campaign to run ads in randomly assigned markets and then tracked the effect of those ads over time using surveys. Advertising did produce a pro-Perry response in the markets that received the treatment. But that bump fizzled fast.

The first generation of elected judges in the early 19th century exercised the power of judicial review far more often than their predecessors did. Perhaps ironically, these democratically elected judges were also the first to criticize democratic excesses and to argue from a countermajoritarian perspective.""""""“I began the book feeling horrified by American judicial elections,” Shugerman says. When his research revealed that a significant impetus behind them was to correct for the corruption and partisanship of judicial appointments, he saw that judicial elections had a good-faith logic in their 19th-century context. From the republic’s earliest days, Shugerman notes, the challenge of judicial selection has been to balance judicial accountability, which demands that judges bend to popular and political pressures, and judicial independence, which demands judicial allegiance to the rule of law. As he mined the historical record, he found that judicial election advocates vied for popular support for their cause by framing it primarily in terms of judicial independence.""""""Of all the methods he looks at, Shugerman claims that merit selection, which involves vetting by a panel of professionals and executive appointment to a first term, followed by retention elections, has yielded the most judicial independence. It is currently employed in about 20 states. But he warns that it, too, may be adversely affected by the excessive campaign spending that preceded and may now be accelerated indirectly by Citizens United.""" [unformatted]

Socialists in the early twentieth century denounced the court for its defense of laissez-faire capitalism. And the Left originated a ton of reform proposals. Since 2016, there has been talk of packing the court in response to the denial of Barack Obama’s last nomination, Merrick Garland, and in response to Ginsburg’s death this talk is reaching a crescendo. But actually, court packing was not what the socialists wanted. They wanted to disempower the court through various devices, like getting rid of judicial review (the power to invalidate popular legislation as unconstitutional), which is a late development in US constitutional history. And socialists also devised various strategies of disempowering the court, like jurisdiction stripping (prohibiting the court from hearing cases) or requiring a supermajority rule for it to strike down laws. All this was thought out a century ago in the context of attempts to get labor law to pass and then survive constitutional scrutiny. Our memories are of court packing, because that’s what FDR attempted.

Segall 2014: the 11th Amendment has been twisted to provide sovereign immuity to states against their own citizens, against the explicit text of the Amendment: <https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6105&context=law_lawreview> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1125685656014823424/segall2014.pdf> """There is perhaps no better example of how Justices Scalia and Thomas ignore clear text and relevant history when it suits their purposes than their interpretations of the Eleventh Amendment, which provides: [t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.29 The Eleventh Amendment quite obviously bars any suit, whether for damages or an injunction, against a state by citizens of “another” state. Both Justices Scalia and Thomas, however, have interpreted this language to bar lawsuits by citizens of a state against their home state.30 In other words, they have taken the word “another” and twisted it to mean “the same.” They engaged in this fancy word play despite the beliefs of four modern Justices that the Amendment only bars suits against states by citizens of a different state, consistent with the clear text.31 Obviously, they must have been convinced by some pretty clear history to so distort unambiguous text. In Justice Scalia’s only discussion of this issue, he relies not on the original meaning of the Eleventh Amendment to support the twisted reading but instead on Hans v. Louisiana, 32 a case decided by the Supreme Court in 1890 (ninety-five years after the amendment was ratified), which adopted that bizarre reading of the Eleventh Amendment with little analysis."""

# originalists have openly accepted that ideas of equality have changed over time
Segall 2017: Bork argued that the 14th amendment introduced a "core idea" about equality: <https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/2/27/14747562/originalism-gorsuch-scalia-brown-supreme-court> """Judge Robert Bork, a hero to originalists, made several arguments about Brown. In a 1971 law review article, he argued that the 14th Amendment “was intended to enforce a core idea of black equality against government discrimination.” In short, he created an abstract ideal, opening the door to arguing that what “equal” meant in 1868 is different from what it meant in 1954 (and today). But of course, once that move is made for “equal,” why not for “due process,” “establishment,” “cruel and unusual,” and other vague constitutional language that Bork thought liberal judges and scholars abused?"""

# gay marriage is anti-originalist
Segall 2017: the framers of the 14th amendment were almost certainly opposed to gay marriage; a strict reading of "equality" would destroy the legality of gay marriage: <https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/2/27/14747562/originalism-gorsuch-scalia-brown-supreme-court> """As Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California Irvine, has pointed out, a serious text-and-history approach (as opposed to a lip service one) would mean the end of judicial protection “for liberties such as the right to marry, the right to procreate, the right to custody of one’s children, the right to keep the family together, the right of parents to control the upbringing of their children, the right to purchase and use contraceptives, the right to abortion, the right to refuse medical care, [and] the right to engage in private consensual homosexual activity. No longer would women be protected from discrimination under equal protection.”"""

# desegregated schools are anti-originalist

But McConnell’s originalist analysis evades this conclusion by focusing not on the 1866–1868 framing/adoption period but on his chosen 1868–1875 postratification timeframe."""

# federalist papers
federalist no. 78: <https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-71-80#:~:text=has%20no%20influence,purse&text=and%20must%20ultimately,judgments> The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.

# ginsberg quotes
Ginsberg opposed court-packing because she felt it would reduce judicial independence: <https://www.npr.org/2019/07/24/744633713/justice-ginsburg-i-am-very-much-alive> """"If anything would make the court look partisan, it would be that — one side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who would vote the way we want them to.' We are blessed in the way no other judiciary in the world is. We have life tenure. The only way to get rid of a federal judge is by impeachment. Congress can't retaliate by reducing our salary, so the safeguards for judicial independence in this country, I think, are as great or greater than anyplace else in the world.""""
Ginsberg's argument hinges on the idea that people follow the judiciary's rulings: <https://www.npr.org/2019/07/24/744633713/justice-ginsburg-i-am-very-much-alive> """But the whole notion of the country's independent judiciary hinges on public trust, she noted. "The court has no troops at its command," Ginsburg pointed out, "doesn't have the power of the purse, and yet time and again, when the courts say something, people accept it." She recalled Bush v. Gore, the controversial case in which the Supreme Court stopped a Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election. "I dissented from that decision," Ginsburg said. "I thought it was unwise. A lot of people disagreed with it. And yet the day after the court rendered its decision, there were no riots in the streets. People adjusted to it. And life went on.""""

news outlets reported about 17% of corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) events studied; a news outlet is more likely to report CSI if the outlet is a daily publication (+3.6-3.9%), if it is left-leaning (+2.8% relative to right-leaning), and if the incident came from a large or well-known corporation; a news outlet is less likely to report CSI if it has an advertising relationship (-.9%) or if it has a selective advertising relationship (-7.8%): <https://www.ama.org/2020/04/01/press-release-from-the-journal-of-marketing-media-bias-with-corporate-social-irresponsibility-events/> <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022242920911907> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/0022242920911907> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/708111548694003773/unknown.png

# publicly funded media effective: govtreon, news vouchers, media vouchers, journalism vouchers

# background: us subsidized media extensively
CJR 2010: uniquely among governments of the time, the US government recognized that the market wouldn't underfund investigative media, so they subsidized media to the tune of $30 billion (0.2% of GDP): <https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/rejuvenating_american_journali.php> <https://archive.ph/I0FMs> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/868276307404935208/unknown.png """There was no notion that “the market,” unsubsidized, would produce sufficient journalism; the idea was unthinkable until the late 19th or early 20th century, when, with the striking explosion in advertising, commercial interests began to prosper. To that end, in the first generations of our nation’s history the federal government instituted extraordinarily large postal and printing subsidies with the explicit goal of broadening and deepening the amount of newspapers and periodical in the United States. These were brilliant subsidies that did not favor a single party or viewpoint; indeed, they made much of the abolitionist press possible while also supporting pro-slavery publications. If the United States federal government devoted the same percentage of GDP to subsidizing journalism today that it did in the 1840s, for example, the expenditure would be around $30 billion. Indeed the one area that distinguished the American government from European governments at the time was its commitment to creating a huge and credible democratic press system."""

# cjr's citizenship news voucher
CJR 2010: explaining the "Citizenship News Voucher" concept: $200/yr voucher to nonprofit media as defined broadly by the IRS: <https://archives.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/rejuvenating_american_journali.php> <https://archive.ph/I0FMs> """The idea is simple: every American adult gets a $200 voucher she can use to donate government money to any nonprofit news medium of her choice. She will indicate her choice on her tax return. If she does not file a tax return, a simple form will be available to use. She can split her $200 among several different qualifying nonprofit media. This program would be purely voluntary, like the tax-form check-offs for funding elections or protecting wildlife. A government agency, possibly operating out of the Internal Revenue Service, can be set up to allocate the funds and to determine eligibility—according to universal standards that err on the side of expanding rather than constraining the number of qualifying media."""

# baker's artistic freedom voucher
Baker 2003: explains the program artistic freedom voucher (AFV): <https://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/20794> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/853444815344369664/baker2003.pdf> """The AFV would allow each individual to contribute a refundable tax credit of approximately $100 to a creative worker of their choice, or to an intermediary who passes funds along to creative workers. Recipients of the AFV (creative workers and intermediaries) would be required to register with the government in the same way that religious or charitable organizations must now register for tax-exempt status. This registration is only for the purpose of preventing fraud – it does not involve any evaluation of the quality of the work being produced."""
Baker 2003: explains funding for the AFV and scope of its benefits: <https://www.policyarchive.org/handle/10207/20794> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/853444815344369664/baker2003.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/868277958396215346/unknown.png """In exchange for receiving AFV support, creative workers would be ineligible for copyright protection for a significant period of time (e.g. five years). Copyrights and the AFV are alternative ways in which the government supports creative workers. Creative workers are entitled to be compensated once for their work, not twice. The AFV would not affect a creative workers ability to receive money for concerts or other live performances. [....] A $100 per adult voucher would be sufficient to pay 500,000 writers, musicians, singers, actors, or other creative workers $40,000 a year. All of the material produced by these workers would be placed in the public domain where it could be freely reproduced."""

[....] Under plausible assumptions, the savings from reduced expenditures on copyrighted material would vastly exceed the cost of the AFV. [....] The AFV would immediately create a pool of money (approximately $20 billion annually) to support creative and artistic workers that is far larger than the amount that currently flows to them through copyright-protected material. [...] [T]he current distribution of royalties and related payments is heavily concentrated among a small group of singers, actors, writers and other creative workers[.] [...] This means that almost all creative workers would stand to earn far more through the AFV system than through the copyright system. [....] The projections assume much more modest savings (20 percent in the high savings scenario and 10 percent in the low savings scenario) in the case of books, advertising, and cable and pay TV. In these cases, a much higher proportion of the costs are attributable to the physical production and distribution of the material, rather than the compensation of the creative workers."""

[...] On Twitter, the center-right is the least represented. On Facebook, both the center and center-right garnered relatively little attention. This pattern suggests that social media sharing in general is more partisan than hyperlinking, and sharing on Facebook is more partisan than on Twitter.
right-wing users exist within a right-wing media echochamber where Breitbart and Fox dominate: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUrGA48clA4> <http://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780190923624.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/536272411893563423/unknown.png While the prominence of individual media sources in the right-wing sphere varies when assessed by shares on Facebook and Twitter, the content and core structure, with Breitbart at the center, is stable across platforms. Even in the highly charged pre-election months, everyone outside the Breitbart-centered universe formed a tightly interconnected attention network, with major traditional mass-media and professional sources at the core. The right, by contrast, formed its own insular sphere centered on Breitbart. [....] Outside the rightwing ecosystem, we did not see a leftward polarization but its opposite—an increase in the authority of, and attention paid to, the traditional professional media that occupy the center and center-left, at the expense of the left. On the right, the most important shift was that Fox News reasserted its authority as the central node of the online right-wing media ecosystem. This revival came at the expense of Breitbart, which declined to second place online (leaving aside Fox dominance of conservative television throughout the election and post-election periods). However, Fox News’s resurgence did not increase connections between the right and the rest of the network. During the election, Fox online received 40 percent of its inlinks from the right quintile. In the year after the election, Fox received 51 percent of its links from the right quintile. This shift reflected a decline in linking to Fox across-the-board, not only from the left. Indeed, links from the center-right and the center to Fox declined proportionately more than did links from the center-left and left.8

# summary
The studies below show that lots of specific methods work. In my opinion, the correct synthesis of these results is that basically *all* methods of persuasion work. While some may work better than others, and may work better on different people, evidence works, logic works, debate works, empathy works, humor works.

# methods: logos, ridicule, empathy: all work
Orosz et al 2016: ridicule & humor (making fun of inconsistencies and of believers in the conspiracy) and logical breakdown (providing stats and explaining logical failures) are equally effective at reducing belief in a Jewish superconspiracy, though the effect size is not large (~3 points on an 88-point scale (3.4pp): <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01525/full> <https://sci-hub.st/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01525/full> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/804880189695852595/orosz2016.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/540432297199927297/fpsyg-07-01525-g001.png

# methods: deep canvassing: compassion works
Kalla and Broockman 2016: deep canvassing (having a ~10 minute conversation encouraging the person to consider a trans person's perspective) increased tolerance of transgender people (~.3 SD) and support for a gender nondiscrimination law (~.5 points on -3 to +3 scale); these effects persisted and strengthened after 3 months, and were robust to a fake negative ad against the law: <https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/magazine/how-do-you-change-voters-minds-have-a-conversation.html> <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/220> <http://sci-hub.st/10.1126/science.aad9713> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/801830550729129984/broockman2016.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/801832782732984350/unknown.png Defining “transgender” in the item wording revealed that placebo subjects were less supportive of protecting this group (P < 0.05, one-tailed). Next, all subjects were less supportive after viewing an opposing ad, but the effect of the conversations endured (P < 0.05, one-tailed). However, the ads’ impact dissipated, whereas the conversations’ effect endured (P < 0.05, one-tailed).

Thus, on the one hand, the amount of political news and information is increasing; on the other, the share of the total media supply constituting political news and information is decreasing. While in some countries soft and game-framed news is on the rise, in others it is not and there is no evidence of a convergence towards a popularization-related reporting style. While there on the one hand is increasing concentration in the media sector, on the other hand there is no compelling evidence of decreasing diversity. Media environments are becoming more fragmented and polarized, and people tend to prefer attitude-consistent information, but most people at the same time still turn to major news providers and also consume attitude-discrepant information. While there is a growing supply of partisan biased and fake information, there is little evidence of a strongly increasing demand for such information. And while the opportunity structures for finding non-political information have improved, it has also become easier for news junkies to find high-quality news and political information. Based on this, one important conclusion coming out of this review is that the direst warnings are not warranted. All news is not bad. Equally important, however, is that all news is not good either and that many of the concerns have a material foundation. There clearly are some trends with respect to political information environments that do represent a serious challenge for democracy."""

The pessimists fear that new media will make people apolitical and provide mind-numbing entertainment that keeps citizens from fulfilling their democratic responsibilities. These two predictions are often presented as mutually exclusive. Things will either spiral upwards orspiral downwards; the circle is either virtuous or vicious. The analyses presented here show that both are true. New media do indeed increase political knowledge and involvement in the electoral process among some people, just as the optimists predict. Yet, the evidence supports the pessimists’ scenario as well. Other people take advantage of greater choice and tune out of politics completely.

Indeed, our findings suggest that it is more about quality than quantity since traditionalists consume information from a lower number of sources than most news profiles identified in this study. Accordingly, consuming news from a broader range of news outlets, channels, programs, and platforms does not necessarily make for a more informed citizenry, and it may even lead to the opposite. As our analyses show, respondents embedded in the hyperconsumers news profile are less politically knowledgeable than the average news user. In line with previous research (van Erkel and Van Aelst 2020), this may be due to information overloads and a tendency for news snacking over actual news reading. The avalanche of information and constant stream of news stories people are currently exposed to (not least on social media) makes it plausible that individuals using a multitude of sources find it ever harder to retrieve and process information from their available media. Indeed, compared to the other news profiles, hyperconsumers of news use a greater number of online news outlets and social platforms for news.9"""

# infotainment effects on cynicism: mixed
Jebril Albæk Vreese 2013: among infotainment, a focus on the personal lives of politicians increases cynicism, while a focus on human interest stories decreases cynicism: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0267323112468683> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/0267323112468683> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1084766184924254228/jebril2013.pdf> """Our findings demonstrate that exposure to infotainment has both positive and negative effects on political cynicism depending on the nature of infotainment content and public interest in politics. Specifically, we found that exposure to privatized news generates cynicism among the general public whereas exposure to personalized coverage has the reverse effect, especially among those who are less interested in politics."""

Maddox and Creech 2021: Contrapoint's strategy keeps "with agonistic debate strategies" (agonistic meaning competive discourse, as opposed to deliberative discourse): <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527476420953549> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/1527476420953549> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024437879218372638/maddox2020.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024435146696429578/unknown.png """One profile notes “Contra[Points] may not have all of the answers, but she has one: meet them on their turf and outdo them” (Singal 2017). The profile goes on to say, “Wynn. . .actually engages with the arguments she is disagreeing with, showing why they are wrong rather simply pointing at them and laughing or screaming” (Singal 2017). In keeping with agonistic debate strategies, ContraPoints videos will invoke the extremist viewpoint in question, dismantle it, and avoid dismissing the view as only racist, sexist, or transphobic. In an interview with Vice, Wynn defends her strategies, stating, “From a psychological standpoint, you have to empathetically enter a person’s world; not just why do they think what they think but why do they feel what they feel? Repeat that back to them and you can really gain traction” (Hall and Brownstein 2019). Similarly, a Los Angeles Times profile features praise from one of Wynn’s LeftTube peers: “Natalie speaks their language,” Ellis says. “That’s something a lot of leftists can’t do. They can’t reach these borderline edgelord communities because they don’t speak the language of memes or why these people tend to fall down reactionary alt-right rabbit holes.” (Fleishman 2019) ContraPoints succeeds where others fail."""
Maddox and Creech 2021: "ContraPoints’ approach works because it engages with epistemological assumptions" rather than "shaming people for holding those assumptions": <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527476420953549> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/1527476420953549> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024437879218372638/maddox2020.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024442199049506847/unknown.png """It is the implicit appeal of Wynn’s style that is often cited as the core to her “deradicalizing” strategy (CBC Radio 2019; Loewinger 2019). In a 2019 episode of National Public Radio’s “On the Media,” hosts interviewed one young man who attributed his turn away from extreme right-wing content to ContraPoints: It started off as hate watching and then it became, you know, “Mmm, I don’t hate her. She’s funny.” And once you get rid of that hate you can start to actually listen to what she’s saying. . . I couldn’t tell you what it is about them, but you do not feel like you are being attacked. That’s when I started to deradicalize, so to speak.” (Loewinger 2019). As the quotation suggests, ContraPoints’ approach works because it engages with epistemological assumptions, in lieu of shaming people for holding those assumptions. Once again citing the LA Times interview with LeftTuber Lindsay Ellis, Jeffrey Fleishman writes, “[Ellis] was impressed that Wynn realized that shaming people might feel righteous but doesn’t change minds, especially if you’re trying to alter the thinking of right-wing and other extremist groups” (Fleishman 2019). Similarly, Vice reports, “Wynn acknowledges that to deradicalize someone you have to engage with their ideas, but this method isn’t exactly popular” (Hall and Brownstein 2019) and CBC Radio notes that ContraPoints “debunk[s] the rationales behind those views, but also convey[s] in her videos that they weren’t monsters. They were merely lost” (CBC Radio 2019). The journalistic discourse surrounding ContraPoints sets the terms for understanding deradicalization as a valuable end, positioning Wynn’s dialogic method as an ideal means. This is one reason why ContraPoints’ work has been described as “the beginnings of a blueprint for countering the rise of right-wing extremist and indoctrination content on the video-sharing site” (Singal 2017). With this is mind, we now turn to unpacking that blueprint."""

# harassment: causes of harassment from rightist videos to leftist videos
Lewis Marwick Partin 2021: 13 right-wing or anti-SJW response videos led to substantial harassment, as guaged by the study authors; they followed a "blueprint of harassment", where creators: [1] "addressed the audience directly" [2] "implicate their audiences by positioning them as targets" of critique by the video creator, which "directs [their] followers to see it as a personal attack" [3] use "offensive language" [4] paint their target as "irrational" and "violating norms shared between creator and audience", which "can serve as justifications for networked harassment" [5] "audience is thus encouraged to defend themselves": <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764221989781> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/0002764221989781> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024404169181888582/lewis2021.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024407885825982554/unknown.png """This blueprint for harassment is echoed in the majority of videos in our corpus. By mixing ad hominem attacks with misrepresentation and criticism of left-wing beliefs, creators stoke moral outrage in their networked audience by suggesting the vlogger is attacking or harming White people, men, children, or America, and provide a list of talking points that can be repeated when harassing a target. Thus, harassment is implicitly justified as righting a moral wrong, reinforcing the norms of the networked audience. Taken together, we argue that these phenomena—the staging of a faux “rational” debate while simultaneously invoking moral outrage among like-minded viewers — offers conditions for networked harassment even when it is not called for or is even repudiated by creators."""
Lewis Marwick Partin 2021: 2 left-wing response videos (by Shaun and by Hbomberguy, respectively) did not lead to substantial harassment; authors argue that this results from staying "more faithful to the faux-staged debate format than the right-wing videos" (ie, citing "archival and scholarly sources, explaining historical events"); this results in comments that "adhere to the debate style employed by Shaun" and are "solemn and factual": <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764221989781> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/0002764221989781> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024404169181888582/lewis2021.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024404975620722799/unknown.png

Politics on YouTube seem to do this in a way that traditional media fails to do. What’s more, according to Van Zoonen (2005, p. 11) there is no support for the accusation that new media and what she refers to as infotainment has made citizens less informed and more apathetic. Citizen today live in a highly mediated society, and politics has to compete for people’s time and attention (Ibid, p. 2-3.)"""
Grude 2021: YouTube politics often combines pop culture and multiple interests/hobbies, which means it competes less with other audiovisual entertainment for limited viewer time/attention: <https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/11250/2761211> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024410904193925171/grude2021.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1024410687256150207/unknown.png """Though politicians often try to make themselves more likeable by acting more like celebrities performing politics (Street, 2019, p. 4), political YouTubers, especially the Casual YouTubers, were more entertaining for my informants because of a few key factors: their personalities were considered more enjoyable, they build closer bonds with the viewers and come across as “just normal people,” and the political content they cover is more entertaining than that of traditional politicians. When it came to the political content being more enjoyable, there were two major reasons why: the perception that politics on YouTube is more inclusive of different ideas and allows for more voices to be heard, and that politics on YouTube covers cultural politics, which was perceived to be internationally important. Political YouTubers also incorporate pop culture into their own content and use it to promote their own ideas and political stances. That way they are not competing as much for viewers time with other types of audio-visual entertainment, because their content can be entertaining on its own. Political YouTubers also have a massive advantage over traditional politicians when it comes to coming across as a “regular person.” What makes someone a “regular person” is different depending on context, but it is contrasted by what people think of as a “politician,” to the point where politicians now are hesitant to label themselves as politicians (Van Zoonen, 2005, p. 5). Instead, they try to find a balance between a life as a serious politician and as a unique individual (Ibid, p. 69). Top US politicians seem to have recognized that YouTube can be a way to access more people and showcase themselves as relevant and in touch with contemporary culture; both Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ihlan Omar of the Democratic Party have played Among Us, a popular whodunit-style video game, with several of the political YouTubers mentioned in this paper on a livestream. It might be a good idea for politicians to get friendly with those YouTubers, too: it was clear from my interviews that my informants had a great deal more trust towards the YouTubers they followed than actual politicians, showing the most distrust towards politicians and political YouTubers they disagreed with politically."""

Why do our movements more and more often feel like we are moving with sharp teeth against ourselves? And what is at stake because of that pattern, that feeling? Why does it feel like someone pointing at someone else and saying: “that person is harmful!,” and with no questions or process or time or breath, we are collectively punishing them, tearing them, and anyone protecting them, to shreds? Sometimes we even do it with the language of transformative justice: claiming that we are going to give them room to grow. They need to disappear completely to be accountable. We are publicly shaming them so that they will learn to be better. Underneath this logic I hear: we are good and we are getting rid of the “bad” people in our community or movement. We are affirming our rightness and power. Which isn’t to say that some of the accused aren’t raging white supremacists in movement clothing. Or abusers who have slipped through the fingers of accountability. Or shady in some other way. Which isn’t to say that a public accounting of harm, and consequences, isn’t necessarily the correct move. In cases of rape, sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and abuse, the callout can be the only move that stops the immediate harm without engaging the state. Shaming behaviors of abuse in a culture where they have been normalized is, and has been, a necessary survival technology. Which isn’t to say we don’t believe survivors. Because we must. In fact, part of what inspired this piece is making room for survivors to be heard. But how do we believe survivors and still be abolitionist? And still practice transformative justice? To start with, I have been trying to discern when a call out feels powerful, like the necessary move, versus when it feels like a feeding frenzy. The first and biggest thing is that call outs never feel powerful to me as a move to resolve conflict, especially when that conflict is unveiled without the consent of both or all parties in the dispute. Call outs don’t work for addressing misunderstandings, issuing critiques, or resolving contradiction. Call outs feel most powerful when they are used with their tactical intention—for those with less positional, political, economic, or other power to demand accountability to stop harm or abuse."""

To expect a coherent authentic apology from someone who has been forcibly removed from power or credibility feels like a set up. Usually they issue some PR-sounding thing that works like blood in the water, escalating the feeding frenzy instead of satisfying our hunger for justice. We’ve all seen the convoluted, denial-accountability-nonapology message from accused harm doers, especially when physical or sexual harm is involved. Sometimes they are claiming innocence, sometimes they are admitting to some harm, rarely at the level of the accusation. Sometimes they say they tried to have a process but it didn’t work, or they were denied. Who knows what they mean by process, who knows if the accuser was ready for a process, who knows what actually happened between them, the relational context of the instance or pattern of harm? Who knows? The truth about sexual assault and rape and patriarchy and white supremacy and other abuses of power is that we are swimming in them, in a society that has long normalized them, and that they often play out intimately. The truth is, sometimes it takes a long time for us to realize the harm that has happened to us. And longer to realize we have caused harm to others. The truth is, it isn’t unusual to only realize harm happened in hindsight, with more perspective and politicization. But there’s more truth, too. The additional truth is, right now, in the frantic pause of pandemic, we have the time. The additional truth is, even though we want to help the survivor, we love obsessing over and punishing “villains.” We end up putting more of our collective attention on punishing those accused of causing harm than supporting and centering the healing of survivors, and/or building pathways for those who are in cycles of causing harm to change."""

# shame and defensiveness in anti-racism
Lopez 2016: <https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/15/13595508/racism-research-study-trump>
Beatty 2022: defensiveness hurts anti-racist behavior after becoming aware of bias: <https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/art_sci_etds/2767/> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1064678757878747146/beatty2022.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1064679123970170911/image.png """Many White Americans are motivated to be anti-racist but become defensive when confronted with their involvement in perpetuating racism (Ford et al., 2022; Howell et al., 2017). This defensiveness stems from the psychological need to present oneself in a way that is acceptable to the self (Cramer, 1998; Swann Jr., 2012). For individuals who hold egalitarian values and are motivated to be racially unbiased, confrontations with how they perpetuate racism feel threatening. These confrontations challenge their self-presentation goals and provoke defensiveness (Ford et al., 2022). This defensive response can subvert anti-racist efforts by shifting attention from the problem at hand, mitigating racism towards the stigmatized person, to managing the emotional reactivity of the person expressing racism (Ford et al., 2022). As defensive reactions to bias confrontation are counterproductive for addressing racial inequity, approaches are needed to reduce defensive responses to being confronted with bias so that people pursue anti-racist action instead. Personal and prevalent threatening information, like increased bias awareness, amplifies defensive responses (Good & Abraham, 2007; Pohan & Mathison, 1998). Recent evidence suggests that interventions can mitigate defensive responses through education (Vitriol & Moskowitz, 2021). Before individuals received feedback that they were biased, researchers told individuals that bias is common and controllable. This brief educational intervention successfully reduced defensiveness about accusations of bias but had limited impacts on general awareness about bias and unknown impacts on other bias-related beliefs and motivations."""

More cops means less violent crime -- but at significant public expense, especially given the egregious underfunding of US welfare system. Re-allocation of cop time to *street presence* (or replaced/supplemented by community volunteers) may have similar effects.

# more cops less murder: causal evidence: chalfin [todo xxx]
Chalfin et al 2020 preprint: brief list of studies supporting alternatives to policing, including several "social service strategies": <https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200792> <https://www.nber.org/papers/w28202> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/790776020152221706/chalfin2020.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1086689892291063828/image.png """Of course, reducing funding for police could allow increased funding for other alternatives. Indeed an array of high-quality research suggests that crime can, in certain contexts, be reduced through methods other than policing or its by-product, incarceration. Among the many alternatives to police for which there is promising evidence are placebased crime control strategies such as increasing the availability of trees and green space (Branas et al., 2011), restoring vacant lots (Branas et al., 2016, 2018; Moyer et al., 2019), public-private partnerships (Cook and MacDonald, 2011), street lighting (Doleac and Sanders, 2015; Chalfin et al., 2019), and reducing physical disorder (Sampson and Raudenbush, 2001; Keizer et al., 2008). There is also evidence that social service-based strategies such as summer jobs for disadvantaged youth (Heller, 2014; Gelber et al., 2016; Davis and Heller, 2017), cognitive behavioral therapy (Blattman et al., 2017; Heller et al., 2017), mental health treatment (Deza et al., 2020) and local non-profits more generally (Sharkey et al., 2017) can have important crime-reducing effects. While social service terventions are often difficult to scale (Mofiitt, 2006; Ludwig et al., 2011), the increasing number of studies which show that there are ways to reduce crime outside the deterrence channels of the traditional model of Becker (1968) is encouraging."""

[....] While information on the use of force by police officers is not collected nationally, if we use the estimate in Weisburst (2019a)–that 2.7 percent of arrests lead to an incident in which force was used by a police officer–then hiring one additional police officer would yield between 3 and 6 use of force incidents per life saved through homicide abatement."""

This could occur through changes in policy like the decriminalization of drug possession or via efforts to recruit a larger number of Black or female police officers (Donohue III and Levitt, 2001; McCrary, 2007; West, 2018; Miller and Segal, 2019; Harvey and Mattia, 2019; Ba and Rivera, 2020; Linos and Riesch, 2020). Moreover, there is growing evidence to support the efficacy of de-escalation training (Engel et al., 2020) and procedural justice training (Owens et al., 2018; Nagin and Telep, 2020; Wood et al., 2020), federal oversight of police agencies (Powell et al., 2017; Goh, 2020), and the use of and training in non-lethal weapons (MacDonald et al., 2009; Sousa et al., 2010). There is likewise support for the idea that reforms to police unions may be effective (Dharmapala et al., 2019) especially if unions can be incentivized to “self-regulate,” which could take the form of transferring the burden of liability insurance from municipalities to unions (Ramirez et al., 2018; Ba and Rivera, 2019). Finally, police officers tend to be highly responsive to managerial directives (Mummolo, 2018), which suggests that procedural reforms could meaningfully alter officer behavior even holding police force size fixed."""

About a year ago, Stephen Mello of Princeton University assessed the Obama-era increase in federal police funding. Thanks to the stimulus bill, funding for Clinton’s Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring grant program surged from about $20 million a year in the late-Bush era to $1 billion in 2009. The program design allowed Mello to assess some quasi-random variation in which cities got grants. The data shows that compared to cities that missed out, those that made the cut ended up with police staffing levels that were 3.2 percent higher and crime levels that were 3.5 percent lower.

# mechanism: not through incapacitation but through deterrence
It’s important in that context to note a recent study by John MacDonald, Jeffrey Fagan, and Amanda Geller that looked at localized policing surges in New York City (dubbed “Operation Impact” by the NYPD) over a period of years. They found that surges led to both less crime and more “stop and frisk”-type incidents where officers stopped citizens (typically young black or Latino men) without probable cause. That suggests a sharp trade-off between crime reduction and civil rights. But the same study, by looking at the covariance of “stop and frisks” and crime reduction, found that the additional stops were doing nothing to reduce crime. All of the anti-crime impact, in other words, came from putting more cops on the beat rather than from the use of aggressive tactics. New York City, not coincidentally, has continued to enjoy low and falling crime rates since stop and frisk tactics were curtailed. What’s helpful is more officers, not more harassment. <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157223> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1371/journal.pone.0157223> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/751274851616030800/macdonald2016.PDF>

# implication: more workers, shorter shifts: fight fatigue [xxx reread]
The key mechanism here is fatigue — which while obviously not a substitute for curing systemic racism, is a lot easier to fix with concrete short-term steps. Tired officers, across a variety of studies, generate more complaints from the civilians they interact with. https://www.governing.com/topics/public-justice-safety/gov-police-officers-overworked-cops.html
A 2017 audit of the Kings County Sheriff’s Department in Washington found that working a single hour of overtime led to a 2.7 percent increase in the odds that the officer would be involved in a use-of-force incident the following week. https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/auditor/new-web-docs/2017/kcao-overtime-2017/kcao-overtime-2017.ashx?la=en
A 2015 study of police officers in Phoenix found that being assigned to a 13-hour rather than 10-hour shift led to increases in fatigue and Professional Standards Bureau complaints. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1098611115584910?journalCode=pqxa
A 2018 study found that working back-to-back night shifts increased the odds of public complaints, and that the effect is particularly large when the officers had to make court appearances in the daytime between the night shifts. https://academic.oup.com/sleep/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sleep/zsy231/5195409?redirectedFrom=fulltext

In more recent years, it was found that in 1999, 45.4% of individuals and in 2004, 43.3% of individuals were re-incarcerated within three years of their release (Pew Center on the States, 2011). <https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/12/04/the-misleading-math-of-recidivism>

Prisons should not be used with the expectation of reducing criminal behaviour. 2. On the basis of the present results, excessive use of incarceration has enormous cost implications. 3. In order to determine who is being adversely affected by prison, it is incumbent upon prison officials to implement repeated, comprehensive assessments of offenders’ attitudes, values, and behaviours while incarcerated. 4. The primary justification of prison should be to incapacitate offenders (particularly, those of a chronic, higher risk nature) for reasonable periods and to exact retribution.`

# recidivism: negative effects
Falk et al 2013: in Sweden from 1973-2004, persistent violent offenders (3+ convictions) did the majority of violent crime [sexual violence excluded]: 0.12% of the population received 19.8% of the violent crime convictions (1/10 do 20), 1.02% received 63.2% (1 do 63), and 3.91% received all 100% (4 do 100); compared with sex- and age-matched non-offenders, violent offenders were significantly more likely to have personality and mental disorders, violent convictions before 19 and , and nonviolent criminality: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-013-0783-y> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/s00127-013-0783-y> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865143068180217866/falk2013.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865137886000578560/127_2013_783_Fig2_HTML.png

In MST, therapists lead a regimented three- to five-month family intervention process involving multiple contacts each week in the family’s home and surrounding community. FFT employs office-based counseling (an average of 12 sessions) designed first to engage family members and then to support meaningful behavior changes that improve family interaction and address the underlying causes of delinquent behavior. Costs average $6,000 to $9,500 per youth for MST and $3,000 to $3,500 for FFT, whereas **a typical stay in a juvenile corrections facility (9 to 12 months at $241 per day) costs $66,000 to $88,000.**

Indeed, information on ‘overdose’ only became available in November 2010 (following calls by the EMCDDA and Instituto da Droga e da Toxicodependência (IDT) for harmonisation and improvement of indicators of drug-related deaths) [12]. Until recently the primary indicator ‘drug-related deaths’ has been produced by the INML [National Institute of Forensic Medicine] and defined as the number of deaths that involve a positive post-mortem toxicological test for the presence of illicit substances [12]. It is the only data available before and after the reform, but it has two major limitations. First, as noted by Greenwald, it is responsive to changes in recording practices, such as the number of toxicological autopsies. Second, it is only an indirect indicator of attributable death; many people are found to have traces of a drug in their body when they die, but this does not mean that the drug caused the death. This is why the standard international classification of drug-related death relies on reports by physicians on their assessment of the cause of death, not positive toxicological tests [41]. The data weaknesses and a substantial rise in toxicological autopsies from 2005 to 2009 give merit for suggesting that as argued by both Greenwald and our own account [8], the rise in ‘positive post-mortem toxicological tests’ may have been largely spurious. Yet neither the possibility of a spurious change nor substantial changes in recording practices were mentioned in the Pinto accounts."""
Hughes and Stevens 2012: explains the strengths of the INE drug death data: it follows international standards of attributing a death to drugs when doctors determine the drug caused their death: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22212070/> <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00383.x> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00383.x> """Data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) has recently been made available and backdated from 2001 onwards. This provides a more accurate indicator of drug-attributable death as it refers to the number of people that have been determined by doctors according to International Classification of Diseases protocols to have died due to drugs [12]. INE data support the hypothesis that the reported rise in the INML data was spurious as the number of people determined by physicians to have died due to drug use decreased from 2001, with a slight increase from 2005 to 2008/9 (to levels that remain much lower than at the time of decriminalisation) [12,42] (see Figure 4).This is not to say that decreases are attributable solely to the reform, with the expanded services a more plausible explanation, but a key goal of the reform had been to reduce social stigma and thereby facilitate access to Portuguese drug treatment and harm reduction services. As shown in Hughes and Stevens [8] drug treatment access in Portugal expanded considerably post-reform. This provides partial evidence that the reform may have contributed to the observed declines."""

# crime
the illegal drug market causes violent crime and cannot be solved by increased law enforcement: <http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(11)00022-3/fulltext> The present systematic review demonstrates that drug law enforcement interventions are unlikely to reduce drug market violence. Instead, and contrary to the conventional wisdom that increasing drug law enforcement will reduce violence, the existing scientific evidence base suggests that drug prohibition likely contributes to drug market violence and increased homicide rates and that increasingly sophisticated methods of disrupting illicit drug distribution networks may in turn increase levels of violence.

In a careful study in which actual serum thiopental concentrations were measured against clinical endpoints, the steady state serum concentration needed to produce a 50% probability of no muscle response (Cp50) after intubation was defined as 78·8 mg/L (SD 2·9).7 The Cp50 for movement after trapezius muscle squeeze, a stimulus equivalent to skin incision, was 38·9 mg/L (3·3). Remarkably, 43 of the 49 inmates had blood thiopental concentrations below this level. Most worryingly, 21 inmates had concentrations less than the Cp50 for repression of movement in response to a vocal command. In view of these data, we suggest that it is possible that some of these inmates were fully aware during their executions.

"""The incomes of executives, managers, financial professionals, and technology professionals who are in the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution are found to be very sensitive to stock market fluctuations. **Most of our evidence points towards a particularly important role for financial market asset prices, shifting of income between the corporate and personal tax bases, and possibly corporate governance and entrepreneurship, in explaining the dramatic rise in top income shares.**"""

Among taxpayers who were in the top 0.1 percent of the income distribution ranked by income including capital gains, salary income and business income accounted for 34 percent of income including capital gains, on average 1971-1980, and 56 percent of income including capital gains, on average 2001- 2010.

However, the MRA also indicates that education has led to a compression in incomes: it has resulted in reduced income inequality at both ends of the income distribution. The results also suggest that compared to primary schooling, secondary schooling and educational attainment are more effective at reducing inequality.

As in Dominicis et al.’s (2008) our results suggest that for a 5% level of significance: the effect of inequality on growth is negative and more pronounced in less developed countries than in rich countries; the inclusion of regional dummies in the growth regression of the primary studies considerably weakens such effect; expenditure and gross income inequality tend to lead to different estimates of the effect size. However, contrary to it Dominicis et al. (2008), we find that: the impact of inequality on growth is not significantly influenced by the quality of the data on income distribution or by the use of different panel estimation techniques; crosssection studies systematically report a stronger negative impact than panel data studies. Furthermore, our results suggest that wealth inequality is more pernicious to subsequent growth than income inequality is.

In accordance with Barro (2000), we found that the correlation between growth and income inequality is different in rich as compared to poor countries. The negative impact of an uneven distribution of income is higher in less developed countries.""""""The longer the length of the growth period (ie, from 5 to 10 to 20 years), the lower the coefficient estimates of the correlation between income and economic growth [become].

If the income share of the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point, GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage point higher growth.

When Canadian provinces and U.S. states are considered together, local levels of income inequality appear to be sufficient to account for the two countries' radically different national homicide rates.

# wealth inequality from inheritance
Adermon Lindahl Waldenström 2016: inheritance accounts for 50-60% of the effect of parental wealth on child wealth: <https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/128/612/F482/5089449> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/ecoj.12535> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1163977165474377748/adermon2018.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1163976975560478761/image.png?ex=65418908&is=652f1408&hm=d02509cece6f2a78b3bbda04539bf1d0f2b18f25fe885fdf93b19d9d12ae1a29& """The results suggest that bequests are an important source of an individual’s wealth status. Regressing child wealth rank on inheritance rank (columns 1 and 4) show high and statistically significant correlations between 0.32 and 0.38. Turning to the baseline generational equation (columns 2 and 5), parental wealth correlations are around the same levels as seen before, between 0.26 and 0.31. When adding ranked inheritance to the baseline model (columns 3 and 6), parental wealth correlations drop to 0.12 and 0.14, which represents a drop of between 50 and 60 per cent. This is a remarkably large reduction, suggesting that inherited wealth accounts for the majority of the measured intergenerational wealth correlation."""
direct transfers probably account for most of the environmental correlation between parent and child wealth: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w21409.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/537336682807296050/unknown.png Column 6 of Table 5 presents the estimates when we control for all these possible mechanisms together. All together, we can explain almost 50% of the effect of the biological parent’s wealth effect on children’s wealth, while we are able to explain only a bit more than 20% of the adoptive parent’s wealth effect. 47 Given that most of the environmental effect remains unexplained by earnings, savings rates, and investment returns, direct financial transfers from parents to children are a likely explanation for much of the environmental effect. 48 However, we do not have data on financial transfers that would allow us to study this directly.

# wasted
inheritances are squandered: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w12569.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542511150122663947/unknown.png The estimated coefficient on the latter is 0.79 with a standard error of 0.03. This suggests that wealth increases by only $0.79 for every dollar in inheritance received. Alternatively stated, individuals consume 21 percent of the inheritance received. With an adjusted R squared of 0.53, inheritances seem to explain quite a bit of the observed change in wealth.

# reduced labor-force participation
large inheritances reduce laborforce participation (the rich clock out): <https://www.nber.org/papers/w12569.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/537337811301564416/unknown.png When the observations are weighted, the estimated effects of inheritances change little as shown in column (3). The estimated coefficient on inheritances becomes -2.66 (se=0.85), with an estimated marginal effect of -0.035 (se=0.018).14 An inheritance of $1 million, other things equal, reduces labor force participation by about 11 percent.

# effects of heterogenous preferencs on income inequality and wealth inequality
#####o
# summary
Libertarian and conservative intellectuals usually explain income inequality and wealth inequality through heterogenous preferences (differences in desire and behavior). Usually, they state that the rich have "long" time preferences (they have a smaller discount rate, and thus value future consumption more, so they are more "patient" and don't "fritter away" their wealth) and lower risk aversion (which allows them to take on higher-yield but higher-risk investment, which results in higher long-term income and wealth). However, these factors can only explain a small portion of actual wealth inequality.

For instance, modeling entrepreneurship usually implies that the adverse responses of savings and economic activity to increased taxation are significant, and especially so if taxation affects the returns to running a business (Kitao [68], Lee [77], and Cagetti and De Nardi [26]). In contrast, in a model with high earnings risk for the top earners, Kindermann and Krueger [67] conclude that the optimal marginal income tax rate is close to 90%. Thus, more work needs to be done to more conclusively determine the effects of taxation in quantitative models of wealth inequality."""

"""The effect of β [discount rate] heterogeneity on the wealth distribution is shown in table 4. Relative to the baseline case without preference heterogeneity, more (impatient) households are pushed towards zero wealth. At the same time, the fraction of wealth held by the richest households increases slightly. Quantitatively, the effect is much smaller than in Krusell and Smith (1998). The reason is that the households studied here are finitely lived, retire when old, and do not leave bequests. Abstracting from bequests could be a concern, but it is shown in Hendricks (2004) that neither accidental nor intended bequests have large e§ects on the model properties studied here. One reason is that, in the data as well as in calibrated model economies, the majority of households leaves either no or only very small bequests. This is not the case in Krusell and Smithís model, where households do not decumulate wealth in retirement.""""""The previous section showed that the contribution of time preference heterogeneity towards accounting for high wealth observations is modest, if preference parameters are chosen to replicate observed age-inequality profiles. It is useful to ask whether preference heterogeneity could be more important, if the distribution of preference parameters were chosen in a di§erent way. One way of obtaining an upper bound for the role of preference heterogeneity is to choose preference weights so as to match points on the Lorenz curve for wealth.""""""If the distribution of preference parameters is disciplined to replicate the observed age inequality proÖles of consumption or wealth, the contribution of time preference heterogeneity towards accounting for the observed concentration of wealth is modest. The fraction of wealth held by the richest 1% of households rises slightly, but still falls far short of the data. At the same time, too many impatient households are pushed towards zero wealth. Even if preference parameters are chosen to match points on the Lorenz curve for wealth, the model economies do not come close to replicating the largest wealth holdings. Time preference heterogeneity is more promising for understanding how wealth inequality changes with age and why households with similar lifetime earnings hold very di§erent amounts of wealth. The model economies come very close to replicating the observed age proÖle of wealth inequality and the empirical Gini coe¢ cients of retirement wealth within lifetime earnings deciles. However, the correlation between lifetime earnings and retirement wealth remains too high. Moreover, all of the model economies substantially over-predict the wealth di§erences between earnings rich and earnings poor households."""

Finland’s annual homeless reports attributed the stalled progress to a group of people with high support needs who were experiencing long-term homelessness, analogous to chronic homelessness in the United States (Pleace, 2017). Researchers suggested that the staircase approach “can work well with those who have opted for substance abuse rehabilitation and can cope with shared housing.

I provide event study evidence that for every 10% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet. In addition, I show that new high-rises attract new restaurants, which is consistent with the hypothesis about amenity effects.

Rents for new high-rises are 60% higher than the average rents in their census tracts, and 30% higher than the average of the upper quartile in their census tracts; see Appendix D.3 for details. To test whether those luxury buildings can meaningfully decrease rents for low-end and mid-range rental buildings, I consider rental buildings’ percentiles in their census tracts based on their 2013 annual rents per unit.35 In this paper, a low-end rental building is categorized as a rental building with relatively low rents per unit in its census tract.""""""To test whether those luxury buildings can meaningfully decrease rents for low-end and mid-range rental buildings, I consider rental buildings’ percentiles in their census tracts based on their 2013 annual rents per unit.35 In this paper, a low-end rental building is categorized as a rental building with relatively low rents per unit in its census tract. As shown in Table 4, within census tracts, new high-rises significantly decrease rents for mid-range rental buildings. It is presumably because of migration chain that as highincome neighbors move into new high-rises, leaving behind older housing stock for middleclass households. Those older housing stock increase mid-range housing supply. However, the rent decrease for low-end rental buildings is not significant in the medium-term.36"""

He explicitly does not cast doubt on the filtering process, by which more expensive homes become more affordable as they age, or the idea that more new housing in the region overall puts downward pressure on prices. “You have to build enough housing for the people who want to live here; otherwise, prices are going to go up,” says Damiano. “Nothing in our research contradicts that fundamental assumption. We’re looking at things in very fine detail on small spatial scales and seeing that there are bumps in the road. Things don’t just work like you would expect in a textbook.”"""

I then find the tenants currently living in those buildings and track them to their previous residence, iterating for six rounds and, in order to focus on local connectivity, keeping only within-metro-area moves in each round. Results are shown in Figure 2. About 20 percent of residents moving into the new buildings came from neighborhoods (census tracts) with household incomes below the median for that metro area (black dot, migration round 1); this proportion rises steadily to 40 percent in round six.

# summary
Private social spending is not the same as private charity. Private social spending includes any spending by individuals on "social" goods (education, healthcare, etc.), whether voluntary or compelled (as by Obamacare's insurance mandate).

# scope: private social spending
private social spending (including both mandatory spending, eg employer-sponsored healthcare, and voluntary spending) constitutes ~27.5% of total US consumption of goods and services: <https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/03/26/the-u-s-spends-far-too-little-on-social-welfare/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/720047240839954432/image3.png

Jane Addams marveled at how many such organizations “honeycombed” the slums of Chicago. Similarly, Peter Roberts observed that among the Italians the “number of societies passes computation,” while according to John Daniels, the typical Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side of Manhattan “swarms with voluntary organizations of many kinds.” Roberts was amazed at how rapidly Eastern Europeans formed lodges. He reasoned that the communal “tendency is in the blood of the Slav, and it finds expression in organizations in America.” Another study noted that Boston’s Polish “clubs, mutual benefit fraternities, patriotic societies and political organizations are legion. All belong to several insurance societies.” 10 Fraternal and other mutual aid societies also existed among groups not usually identified with the new immigration. To Paul S. Taylor they represented “the only continuous organized life among the Mexicans in which the initiative wholly comes from the Mexicans themselves.” The tendency of Japanese Americans to join associations spurred Konrad Bercovici to conclude, probably with some exaggeration, that nearly “every Japanese belongs to one or more societies.” Associationalism was pervasive among the Chinese. They established numerous societies, including the famous “Six Companies,” which provided sick and funeral benefits and arbitrated disputes. In 1921 Robert E. Park and Herbert A. Miller wrote that “there is nothing mysterious about Chinese institutions. The more data we secure on them, the more we are impressed with their resemblance to our own.” 11 During the same period blacks developed a reputation as “joiners” that rivaled that of recent immigrants. “No racial type,” John Daniels declared, “has a stronger craving to ‘belong.’ They have clubs and societies without number and of every description.” Howard Odum wrote that lodges constituted “a vital part” of black life in the South and estimated that the membership, “paying and non-paying is nearly equal to the total church membership.” Fannie Barrier Williams echoed this assessment, proclaiming that in “nothing does the colored man live such a strenuous life as he does as a lodge man. The lodge, more than any other merely social organization, is a permanent and ever-increasing force.” 12 A recurrent theme was that blacks had a peculiar flair for the art of organization. They were, according to one writer, “more social in disposition and more absorbed in social life than white people.” Even progressive reformer Isaac Rubinow, not usually prone to acknowledge fraternal achievements, declared that “outside of the immigrant groups, Negroes represent the only class of population where the habit of mutual insurance through voluntary association has developed to the highest degree in the United States.”13""""""Studies during the period repeatedly point to the pervasiveness of life insurance ownership among the working class. The Illinois Health Insurance Commission found that 81.9 percent of wage-earning families in Chicago had at least one member with a life insurance policy. Although this tendency declined with income, 73.2 percent of the lowest income class still carried such policies.""""""In Chicago 9 of 10 black families had life insurance (table 2.4), but only 1 in 10 (table 2.3) had fraternal life policies. By the same token, more than 4 in 10 blacks in Chicago carried sick benefits. This ratio was higher than that of any other group except Lithuanians, and twice that of native-born whites.23"""

The members of the race possess in high degree the quality of human kindness, and are ever ready to help their fellows in times of need.” Pride in self-reliance was infectious."""

there was never a time when the state was uninvolved in helping the needy: <https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/32/the-voluntarism-fantasy/> [A] significant amount of research has been done over the past several decades to overturn the myth of a stateless nineteenth century and to rediscover the lost role of the state in the pre-New Deal world. [....] As the political scientist Theda Skocpol has documented, there were also multiple examples of state-issued social insurance programs before the New Deal. In the wake of the Civil War, Congress established an elaborate system of pensions for veterans. At its height in 1910, this de facto disability and old-age pension system delivered benefits to more than 25 percent of all American men over 65, accounting for a quarter of the federal government’s expenditures. Between 1911 and 1920, 40 states passed laws establishing “mothers’ pensions” for single women with children. These programs provided payments for needy widowed mothers in order to allow them to provide for their children.

# longitudinal: charity is not a damper on inequality
Duquette 2018: the rich do not increase philanthropy in response to increased inequality; both in raw data and after controls, the highest-income Americans gave most to charity when income is most egalitarian: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014498318300202> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.eeh.2018.08.002> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073369276142075904/duquette2018.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073371568912224296/image.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073371955773841458/image.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073372049667543152/image.png """This paper has documented a robust negative association between the charitable giving of high-income households and income inequality. Whether looking at long-run data at the national level, cross-sectional micro data, state-level variation, or charity time series, giving at the top is lower when inequality is higher. This is visible in the raw data and when controlling for absolute income, tax incentives, and other confounding factors. These findings rebut the argument that the philanthropy of the rich has reduced inequality over time. Top earners have been less generous in unequal times and places."""

# longitudinal: long-term effects of charity now on charity growth
Duquette 2018: the growth of nonprofits is very long-lasting; US states with more individual charity in 1917 have significantly more nonprofit expenditures in 2013, 95 years later, which actually *exacerbates* inter-region inequality: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014498318300202> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.eeh.2018.08.002> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073369276142075904/duquette2018.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073370278614274089/image.png """Furthermore, the effect of contributions on societies is extremely long-lasting. Nonprofit organizations are dynamic strategists who stockpile resources and build endowments, with the rate of increase often exceeding their payout rate; this behavior has been most thoroughly documented for private foundations (Galle 2017) and for universities (Brown et al. 2014), but aggressive saving of donations has been observed for all major charity sectors (Duquette 2017). It follows that nonprofit goods and services will be increased only slowly by additional giving, and to the extent that foundation investments grow faster than spending, may have a greater effect in the long-run than the short-run. The data confirm this story. The two panels of figure 5 compare nonprofit spending to household charitable contributions at the state level. Panel A compares itemized charitable contributions per capita in a particular state (on the horizontal axis) to spending by all charities and foundations to file an IRS form 990 in that state; both variables are log of per-capita values for 2013. 27 There is no association between how much people gave and how much charities and foundations spent; if anything, the association is weakly negative. This comparison is in sharp contrast to the plot in figure 5B, which compares 2013 charity expenditures to per-capita giving in 1917. A positive correlation is clearly visible and large; per-capita 1917 itemized contributions explains about 30 percent of the variation in per-capita spending across states 96 years later."""

# longitudinal: why are megarich a higher share of charity?
Duquette Mayo 2021: secularization may explain increasing concentration of giving, because more people are not giving small amounts of money to religious organizations: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/1260170923> <https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003139201-18/gives-gets-tax-policy-long-run-distribution-philanthropy-united-states-nicolas-duquette-jennifer-mayo> <http://library.lol/main/CEA37385D4093D5F9763C7CD43C1DD95> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1073452653440401459/duquette2021.pdf> """One possible explanation is that the concentration in individual giving in fact reflects the decline in small-dollar donors. These types of donations are disproportionately religious tithes and can be linked to the growing secularization of giving. Figure 15.7 uses Giving USA data to plot real giving per household to religious and non-religious causes from 1967 to 2019. It depicts a steep rise in non-religious giving in the mid-1990s. In particular, real average giving to religious groups has remained fairly stable at around $1000 per household, while giving to non-religious organizations has more than doubled, from $1000 to $2500 per household. While both religious and non-religious giving is recorded in 1040 data, only non-religious organizations are required to file an IRS Form 990 (religious organizations are exempt).7 This difference in filing requirements means that any disappearance in small-dollar religious donors would be reflected in individual giving but not 990-filing charities’ reported receipts. Of course, this hypothesis can only be tested with donor-level data, but it offers a possible explanation."""

From these aggregates alone, it would be easy to conclude that U.S. giving is stable, predictable, and steadily increasing without cause for concern. This apparent stability conceals important shifts in the distribution of giving activity. While scholars typically think of U.S. giving and philanthropy as a civic culture with wide participation, giving activity has become increasingly concentrated over the past 60 years. Figure 15.2 plots the share of giving by living Americans accounted for by the itemized contributions of the tax units who claim the most giving.1 These shares are computed from publicly available Internal Revenue Service (IRS) cross-sectional data for available years 1960 to 2012.2 These calculations show a rapid increase in the share of giving made by the top donors. In 1960, the top 1% of tax units made 18.9% of all charitable contributions from living individual donors. By 2012, this share had more than doubled to 43.5%."""

Results. Campaigns raised more than $2 billion from 21.7 million donations between 2016 and 2020. Returns were highly unequal, and success was low, especially in 2020: only 12% of campaigns met their goals, and 16% received no donations at all. Campaigns in 2020 raised substantially less money in areas with more medical debt, higher uninsurance rates, and lower incomes. Conclusions. Despite its popularity and portrayals as an ad-hoc safety net, medical crowdfunding is misaligned with key indicators of health financing needs in the United States. It is best positioned to help in populations that need it the least."""

# public spending is countercyclical (increases in recessions: good)
TODO: in 2008-09, public spending jumped from .1 to 2.2% of GDP: in contrast, automatic stabilizers are countercyclical -- they increase during recessions and decrease during expansions -- meaning that public spending decreases recession depth: <https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/32/the-voluntarism-fantasy/> During 2009, while private charity collapsed, automatic stabilizers expanded rapidly, from 0.1 percent of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP—or a number roughly akin to all charitable giving in the United States. This was directly targeted at areas that suffered from the most unemployment, and helped those most in need—efforts that, as we’ve seen, private charity does only partially. As Goldman Sachs economists concluded, this shift made a crucial difference, and, alongside the government’s efforts to prevent the collapse of the banking sector and the Federal Reserve’s expansion of monetary policy, was a core reason the Great Recession didn’t become a second Great Depression.

Or of Einstein. Or of the discoverers of the laser (in which Charles Townes played a central role) 16 or John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley, the inventors of transistors. 17 Or of Watson and Crick, who unraveled the mysteries of DNA, upon which rests so much of modern medicine. None of them, who made such large contributions to our well-being, are among those most rewarded by our economic system. Instead, many of the individuals at the top of the wealth distribution are, in one way or another, geniuses at business. Some might claim, for instance, that Steve Jobs or the innovators of search engines or social media were, in their way, geniuses. Jobs was number 110 on the Forbes list of the world’s wealthiest billionaires before his death, and Mark Zuckerberg was 52. But many of these “geniuses” built their business empires on the shoulders of giants, such as Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, who has never appeared on the Forbes list. Berners-Lee could have become a billionaire but chose not to—he made his idea available freely, which greatly speeded up the development of the Internet.18 A closer look at the successes of those at the top of the wealth distribution shows that more than a small part of their genius resides in devising better ways of exploiting market power and other market imperfections—and, in many cases, finding better ways of ensuring that politics works for them rather than for society more generally."""

# public charity: crowding out or crowding in from government support?
#####o
# summary
This literature examines whether *direct* government support of a particular charity crowds out private donations to that charity. It finds that this crowd-out effect exists, but its size is hard to quantify. A second crowd-out effect, of government giving toward a particular *cause* (such as social spending toward the poor) does not exist.

# summary of meta-analyses: evidence inconclusive, leans crowd-out

Without any statistical control for the endogeneity problem (such as fixed effects and instrumental variables), the estimated relationships could be biased. Thus, a moderator was included in the meta-regression to test this argument. The results from both models underscore the imperative of endogeneity correction: the average effect size is markedly smaller from models embracing some endogeneity-corrected estimates by about .04 ( p < .05).

The easiest way to see this is to look again at Figure 3.5 and Table 3.4. Back in the late 1920s, when government aid to the poor was still only one-sixth of 1 percent of national product, private charity to the poor was the same. The subsequent rise of government “welfare” aid to around 4 percent of gross national product (GNP) by 1995 could not just crowd out private charity, because there was only one-sixth of 1 percent of GNP in private philanthropy that could have been crowded out in the first place. In fact, private charity to the poor rose slightly as a share of donor’s incomes during the expansion of the United States’ tax-based government welfare spending. Before the late 1920s private charity toward the poor had always been negligible, though we lack systematic national figures. It could hardly have been otherwise, so strong was the U.S. opposition to charity."""

However, the results to date span a wide range of samples, examine a diverse set of variables and data sources, and often present conflicting findings. Estimates for price elasticity range from –7.07 (Robinson 1990) to +.12 (Wu and Ricketts 1999). Duquette (1999, p. 16) states that “most studies have found giving to be highly price elastic,” whereas other researchers have presented evidence that strongly challenges the traditional consensus that tax incentives are a powerful stimulus to giving (Bristol 1985; Steinberg 1990).""""""In general, our results support the hypothesis that tax deductions for charitable giving are treasury efficient. That is, on average, a decrease in $1 in the cost of giving can be expected to result in more than $1 being donated to charity through personal philanthropy. However, the treasury efficiency of charitable donations is only one issue for consideration, albeit an important one. Previous researchers have examined the benefits of replacing government support for charities with individual support. For example, Cordes (2001, p. 3) notes the correlation between cash donations and volunteerism and argues that a system encouraging more individual donations would also “help foster civic virtues that are needed to maintain a ‘civil society.’” Others have argued that charity is supported most efficiently through private donations and that encouraging individual donations allows for consumer choice (Brooks 2004). The current analysis highlighted several issues in the study of the effects of tax on individual charitable giving."""

So we conclude from data for the United States, one of the few countries to quantify charitable giving, and perhaps also the country where the most was given privately.

Even if all philanthropy had gone to “welfare” in 1927, that would have delivered only 1.52 percent of GDP, a lower share than England and Wales local governments gave to their poor a century earlier under the Old Poor Law. As Table 14.3 further reminds us, very little of US philanthropy went, or still goes, to the poor. In 1927, only a tenth of a percent of GDP went to “youth services, welfare, and race relations.” The parts of other categories received by the poor and needy were probably offset by the parts of this category they did not receive. The private contributions to “welfare” were much smaller than the amounts contributed to churches, to parochial schools, and to higher education (e.g. the Ivy League or Stanford).""""""We must return to the task of explaining some glaring historical facts that stand out in Figure 14.3: Why was there no significant social insurance or social assistance for most of human history, and why was the eventual rise so unequal among countries?"""

This initially caused a drop in the share of GDP spent on relief. In the period c. 1750–1850, the combination of French conquests with Enlightenment and liberal ideas about poverty resulted in policies directed against corporations, the abolition of guilds and confraternities, secularization, and general criticism of poor relief. With few initiatives by governments to replace the old systems, social spending on the Continent around the middle of the nineteenth century was lower than before. For this reason, the nineteenth century can give a misleading picture about the pre-history of the welfare state. For instance, Lindert correctly shows low levels of poor relief around 1800 and a slow rise only from the late nineteenth century on.131 However, the long-run view of this article shows that the first half of the nineteenth century was an exception and had lower levels of poor relief than before. Moreover, pre-industrial figures are not necessarily much lower than those for 1850–1950. The real break in social assistance only came about with the development of the modern welfare state in the second half of the twentieth century. The industrial revolution and the associated rises in productivity in themselves did not cause a fundamental shift in this regard."""

Chapters 4, 5, and 7 trace the effects of switching from nondemocracies to elite democracies and then to full democracies, with both genders and all economic classes permitted to vote. Part of that history comes from written accounts and part from a systematic statistical analysis of twenty-one countries in the periods 1880–1930 and 1962–1995. For social transfers, such as aid to the poor, the elderly, and the sick, elite democracies tended to offer no more than the average nondemocracy, when other things are held equal. The elite democracies, in which fewer than 40 percent of men had the vote, were actually more opposed to overall social transfers, and to public pensions, than the average authoritarian nondemocracy. Only basic poor relief was given out as much in the elite democracies as in the average nondemocratic monarchy of that time. More dramatic were the effects of spreading the vote from an elite to nearly all adults. Once the right to vote was extended to poorer men, the stage was set for Lloyd George’s assault on Britain’s rich just before World War I and for corresponding political transitions in other countries. When that happened toward the end of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth, comprehensive nationwide social insurance programs began to emerge. Extending political voice to all adults raised spending on public schools as well."""

Either: (1) the income effects were in fact large, but their stimulus to giving was largely cancelled by exogenous shifts in tastes away from charity; or (2) the income effects were in fact large, but the rise of the welfare state crowded out what would have been a large rise in private giving by altruists caring about the total amounts that the needy received (induced shift in tastes); or (3) the income elasticities were in fact small and the affluent never felt inclined to give much. Seeing no historical reason why tastes should have shifted away from charity at the same time that incomes accelerated across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, I tentatively doubt the first explanation. The second option – large income effects were offset by crowding out from the welfare state – would have worked if there had been historical evidence of a rise in private giving during a long period when incomes were growing and there was no welfare state. Yet American experience finds a large rise in per capita income from, say, 1800 to 1927 with no appreciable private giving either at the start or at the end of that period. Accepting the third explanation fits with that “warm glow” model favored by the present-day microeconomic literature. Over the centuries, people have given privately because they gain utility from the act of giving, and the amounts they gave did not respond much to competing supplies of aid to the targeted group (i.e. no crowding out of altruists). To the “warm glow” theory, this simple reading of history suggests a friendly amendment: The warm glow is achieved by very low levels of giving. Perhaps over the centuries, donors have gained satisfaction by giving at least something, and felt no need to “give until it hurts.” That would help to explain why there have always been so many charities, with so little closure of poverty gaps."""

To be sure, some private institutions of mutual aid did insure their members, conforming to the tendency toward social affinity, the exchange of help with one’s own social group. To judge from the few data we have, and to conjecture that absence of data tended to betray absence of generous aid, private insurance and mutual aid seemed to have reached their highest levels in the late eighteenth century in England and Wales and the Netherlands, as shown by a few estimates in Table 14.2. Marco van Leeuwen’s important recent study of private Dutch insurance pools in the second half of that century shows significant benefits paid out for burial expenses, sickness benefit, medical costs, widowhood, and old age. For those receiving them, pension and old age benefits ranged from 20 to 50 percent of the typical wage. Yet those covered represented a small fringe of society, mainly middle-class members of large craft guilds in the main cities. Their restrictiveness and small size was one means of avoiding adverse selection.13"""

# effects on growth: on net, all programs combined have a ~zero effect on growth
Lindert 2004: between 1880 and 1990, the correlation between social spending (% of GDP) and either GDP growth or GDP level is essentially zero: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/781625172> <http://library.lol/main/85F0ECC6DE1F4E7EBA9CCAA2BFDCA2E2> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1074084691038191757/lindert2004a.pdf> <https://www.worldcat.org/title/71332850> <http://library.lol/main/36EBBC42EEBF7B63260693841E1D51EE> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1074084691445031004/lindert2004b.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1075229613296472114/image.png Growing Public """Yet the history of economic growth is unkind to this natural suspicion. Neither simple raw correlations nor a careful weighing of the apparent sources of growth shows any clearly negative net effect of all that redistribution. Table 1.3 dramatizes the overall puzzle. Nine decades of historical experience fail to show that transferring a larger share of GDP from taxpayers to transfer recipients has a negative correlation with either the level or the rate of growth of GDP per person. The average correlation is essentially zero. If we pooled all the decades of international experience, instead of just averaging them, we could find that social transfers had positive correlations with both the level and the growth of GDP per person. The strongly positive correlation with the level of GDP per person underlines the Robin Hood paradox: Taking all historical experiences as a single experiment, the richer the country, the more it tends to transfer to the poor, the sick, the elderly, and the unemployed.18 So far, any negative feedback from social programs to productivity levels, or productivity growth, remains well hidden. The puzzle deepens a bit when we switch from GDP per person, the usual measure of income and productivity, to GDP per hour worked, a better measure of labor productivity. If higher social spending dampens incentives to invest and to raise labor productivity, this should make the higher-spending countries fall further behind the lower-spending leaders like the United States and Japan. Yet as others have noted, countries like the Netherlands, France, and Germany have caught up with the United States in output per labor hour. In fact, in GDP per hour worked, the United States ranked below eight other countries in 1992. Six of these eight countries with higher output per hour worked were continental welfare states.19"""

The latter, when they existed, were mostly organized in a guild structure, and they were predominantly aimed at the middle classes who held guild membership and could afford to pay the contributions, rather than at the poor.12""""""In the wave of horizontal association and community formation in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, new charitable organizations emerged, mostly managed by laymen. This was a formative period of institutionalized poor relief, sometimes labelled ‘a revolution of charity’.14 In the villages of the countryside, people organized poor boxes, and the formalization of commons and other organizations of communal agriculture offered the poor access to land or its fruits. Village by-laws across western Europe, in England from the thirteenth century onwards, formalized the right of the rural poor to forage on the common wastelands, to graze one or two animals on the common meadows, or to reap the leftovers or fallen grain after the harvest.15 The latter practice, called gleaning, was important in grain-growing areas where open fields were predominant. To the extent that these rights were not directly connected to landownership they should be considered as part of relief.""""""Unlike modern welfare arrangements, the role of public authorities was limited to some degree of control over charities and hospitals, and they rarely financed poor relief. In Italy and in the Netherlands, governments offered very little direct assistance.23 In England, forerunners of the first poor rates financed through local taxation probably existed before the late sixteenth-century poor laws, but these were not yet systematically collected and only supplemented other forms of relief.24 Relief organizations were largely financed out of the revenues from their assets. A sample of charitable and religious foundations in the late medieval Low Countries showed they obtained on average two-thirds of their income from asset returns.25 Other studies have uncovered similar funding patterns across the Continent in the pre-industrial period.26 Direct donations and taxation played a small role in financing poor relief in this period."""

I find the strongest evidence for the risk channel: households who did not enroll in SCHIP but were otherwise eligible saw significant increases in self-employment, even though their budget constraint had not shifted.

Without more detailed data on payroll, receipts or long-term survival rates it is difficult to answer this question, but Table 5 in the appendix provides some suggestive evidence. Researchers often use incorporation as a measure of entrepreneur “seriousness” or quality (Levine and Rubinstein, 2013), so Table 5 repeats the specifications above using a household’s ownership of an incorporated business as the outcome variables. The effects on incorporation are large: SCHIP caused a 1.5 percentage point increase in incorporation ownership, a 36% increase from the pre-policy baseline (4.1% of households had an incorporated firm before the policy). Since the overall increase in self-employment was only 15%, SCHIP disproportionately encouraged people to open incorporated businesses, shifting the overall composition of firms toward more “serious” ventures.

# social spending enables business formation: evidence from social food income
Olds 2016b: social food income (SNAP / FSP) substantially (3-5%) increased business startups among recipient households: <https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/food-stamp-entrepreneurs-how-public-assistance-enables-business-bootstrapping> <https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=50692> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1072370287947034664/olds2016.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1072371149369004102/image.png Food Stamp Entrepreneurs / Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program / Food Stamps Program """Using these strategies I find that becoming eligible for SNAP increased a household’s likelihood of enrollment by nearly 3-5 percentage points. Newly-eligible households were also around 20% more likely to own a business. Most of the increase in self-employment is the result of new firm birth—which grew by 12%—rather than increased firm survival. These tend to be high-quality firms: the marginal effects were particularly strong for incorporated ventures, with the probability of owning an incorporated business increasing by 16% as a result of the policy. The expansion of SNAP also increased the length of the work-year by 2.5% and the work-week by 5% relative to the baseline, a labor supply increase equivalent to 19.6 million full-time workers. There is little evidence that observable characteristics differ between treatment and control groups using the partitioned RD method. Finally, the results are driven entirely by newly eligible non-enrollees. Taken together, these results strongly suggest the presence of a large population of would-be entrepreneurs held back by uninsured risk."""

# causes: administration
administrative spending as a portion of overall healthcare spending is 8% in the US (compared to a mean of 3% for other high-income countries): <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2674671> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/472872275402817556/unknown.png
overhead takes 31% of US healthcare but just 17% of Canadian healthcare spending: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa022033> In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least $294.3 billion in the United States, or $1,059 per capita, as compared with $307 per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada's national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada's private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers' administrative costs were far lower in Canada.
in 2014, administrative expenses (including fraud and abuse control expenses) were $8.8 billion of $613.3 billion total expenditures (1.43%): <https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/reportstrustfunds/downloads/tr2015.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640291423165349903/unknown.png

# fraud: private vs public
fraud elimination has been effective: <http://archive.is/Dn9UB> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/543707411131924482/20140531_USC154.png Federal prosecutors had over 2,000 health-fraud probes open at the end of 2013. A Medicare “strike force”, which was formed in 2007, boasts of seven nationwide “takedowns”. In the latest, on May 13th, 90 people, including 16 doctors, were rounded up in six cities—more than half of them in Miami, the capital city of medical fraud. One doctor is alleged to have fraudulently charged for $24m of kit, including 1,000 power wheelchairs.
the reason Medicare has high fraud rates is because they pay out without checking whether a bill is legitimate(!): <http://medicareintegrity.org/error-rate-drops-but-medicare-still-lost-31-6-billion-to-preventable-billing-errors-in-fy2018/> """Like private payers, Medicare can leverage pre-payment audits to prevent improper payments. In FY2012, CMS successfully tested prepayment audits during the Medicare Prepayment Review Demonstration project. Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) were authorized to review certain error prone Medicare claims for billing accuracy before they were paid. As a result of this short pilot program RACs prevented more than $192 million in improper payments from leaving the Medicare Trust Funds in error. The pilot program was so successful that the GAO recommended that “CMS should actively seek legislative authority to have RAs conduct prepayment claim reviews.”"""
the fraud rate of medicare fee-for-service is about 2x that of healthcare at large: <http://web.archive.org/web/20070813221400/http://www.nhcaa.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=anti_fraud_resource_centr&wpscode=TheProblemOfHCFraud> Each year, for example, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducts a formal audit of the Medicare program’s fee-for-service claim payment system. On February 21, 2002, the HHS-OIG reported its finding that of the $191.8 billion such claims paid in 2001, 6.3 percent – amounting to $12.1 billion – should not have been paid due to erroneous billing or payment, inadequate provider documentation of services to back up the claims and/or outright fraud. In May, 2004, the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) reported in its Anti-Fraud Management Survey that 52 of its member insurers collectively recovered or prevented payment of $503 million in 2003 as a direct result of their anti-fraud activities – a great deal of money, but barely a measurable fraction of the total estimated loss. The bottom line: The NHCAA estimates that of the nation’s annual health care outlay, at least 3 percent – or $51 billion in calendar-year 2003- is lost to outright fraud. Other estimates by government and law enforcement agencies place the loss as high as 10 percent of our annual expenditure – or $170 billion – each year.
medicare-medicaid improperly pays about $65 billion per year (8.7% of $743 billion total): <https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/04/darrell-issa/rep-darrell-issa-claims-government-could-save-125-/> <https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/11/16/improper-payment-progress> <https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/Background_on_Accountable_Government_Initiative.pdf> On June 8, 2010, the President announced that the Administration would cut the improper payment rate in the Medicare Fee for Service program in half by FY 2012. Considering that Medicare and Medicaid combined had about $65 billion in improper payments in FY 2009 including about $35 billion in Medicare Fee For Service alone, halving the improper payment rate would help avoid more than $20 billion in payment errors by FY 2012. [....] About a third of Medicare's improper payments are the result of a claim not having enough, or proper, documentation. Upon further investigation, many of those claims are ultimately deemed proper. One example is a payment based on a claim by a doctor who submits forms that are illegible. Also, not all improper claims can be completely recouped. For example, say a surgeon was paid $10,000 for an inpatient procedure when Medicare only reimburses for an outpatient procedure that costs $5,000. The government wouldn't recoup the full $10,000, just the $5,000.
the overall cost of fraud is estimated at $85 billion to $272 billion per year: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1148376> Fraud and Abuse: the waste that comes as fraudsters issue fake bills and run scams,28 and also from the blunt procedures of inspection and regulation that everyone faces because of the misbehaviors of a very few. We estimate that this category represented between $82 billion and $272 billion in wasteful spending in 2011.20,29

For example, in Pakistan, a matched cohort study in Karachi found that public sector tuberculosis care resulted in an 85% higher treatment success rate than private sector care [63]. In Thailand, patients seeking care in private institutions had significantly lower treatment success rates for tuberculosis, which was attributed to a three to five times greater likelihood of being prescribed non-WHO-recommended regimens than in the public sector [61]. In South Korea, tuberculosis treatment success rates were 51.8% in private clinics as opposed to 79.7% in public clinics, with only 26.2% of patients in private clinics receiving the recommended therapy, and over 40% receiving an inappropriately short duration of therapy [62]. Similarly higher rates of treatment failure were observed for private than public system patients on antiretroviral therapy for HIV in Botswana [64]. In India, an analysis of over 120,000 households, adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors, found that children receiving private health services were less likely to receive measles vaccinations [65]. Similar findings were reported from Cambodia [66].

# payment scheme: terminology
#####o
# schemes
Fee For Service (FFS): This model pays doctors per service provided.
Capitation: This model pays doctors "per capita" (per person in doctor's panel in a period of time). Usually seen in HMO plans. Because doctors receive a flat fee per patient, but must pay this encourages 
Direct Primary Care (DPC): 
Integrated Health Model (IHM): This model integrates health insurance and health workers. Example is Kaiser Permanente.

# terms
panel = group of patients seen by a doctor; typically 1500-2000 in FFS/Capitation/IHM systems and 500 in DPC systems

# abbreviations
PCP = Primary Care Physician, the doctor you go to when you have a tummy hurty
ED = Emergency Department, the doctor you go to when you step on a rusty naily
HMO = Health Maintenance Organization, a plan which usually does NOT cover out-of-network care and requires referrals and a PCP
PPO = Preferred Provider Organization, a plan which usually DOES cover out-of-network care
PPO = Preferred Provider Organization, a plan which usually does NOT cover out-of-network care
HDHP = High Deductible Health Plan, a plan with high deductibles and high out-of-pocket limits
CDHP = Consumer-Driven Health Plan, a plan with high deductibles and high out-of-pocket limits (like HDHP) with an added health savings account (HSA) or health reimbursement account (HRA) to reduce tax burden
PMPM = per member, per month; usually part of capitation schemes
PPPM = per patient, per month; usually part of capitation schemes

Adashi Clodfelter George 2018: because there have been no proper studies on DPC quality, it's unclear whether DPCs have better quality care (or why); the main suggestion is that DPCs have fewer patients per doctor and longer visits per doctor (observed), which improves longitudinal wellbeing (implied by anecdotal data), which results in fewer emergency and specialist visits (observed): <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2688238> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1001/jama.2018.8405> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1195629263269933086/adashi2018.pdf> Direct Primary Care One Step Forward, Two Steps Back """With a smaller patient paneland becauseDPC physicians do not bill third-party payers, physicians can focus on building therapeutic, longitudinal relationships with patients.5 DPC advocates suggest that these changesyield significant improvements in both patientand population-level health outcomes, reducing the rates of hospital readmissions, specialist visits, radiologic and laboratory testing, and emergency care. Individual DPC practices have indicated that practice-level data on outcomes support these claims; however, no study, to our knowledge, has produced data to support anecdotal claims by individual practices."""

Milliman 2020 study: after Union County, North Carolina added a DPC option to its consumer-driven health plan (CDHP) by converting their HSA benefit to a DPC fee, it saved $1.28 million per year and saw substantially healthier patients with lower healthcare utilization: <https://soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2020/direct-primary-care-eval-model.pdf> ,https://dpcreferee.com/2020/05/25/dpc-did-cost-uc-500k/> <https://web.archive.org/web/20200607031143/https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2020/direct-primary-care-eval-model.pdf> """We observed positive cost-related and utilization-related effects from the introduction of a DPC option in the employer’s self-insured health benefits plan. About half of the members included in our analysis enrolled in the DPC option, and the DPC option was associated with a statistically significant reduction in overall demand for health care services (−12.64%) and emergency department usage (−40.51%) after controlling for differences in age, gender and health status between the DPC and traditional cohorts. The DPC option was also associated with a lower inpatient hospital admission rate (−19.90%), but the difference was not statistically significant due to the small number of admissions during the two years analyzed. However, we also estimated that the introduction of a DPC option increased total nonadministrative plan costs for the employer by 1.3% after consideration of the DPC membership fee and other plan design changes for members enrolled in the DPC option."""
^ Ratner 2023: the utilization estimates above are implausible, as they rely on DPC doctors to accurately enter insurance codes (when the purpose of DPC is to avoid spending time on such billing paperwork), and utilization likely actually *rose*; the program cost Union County about $400k more per year than its previous system: <https://dpcreferee.com/2023/10/25/millimans-8pmpm-valuation-is-nonsense/> <https://dpcreferee.com/2020/06/21/the-mixed-bag-of-milliman-a-single-post-critique/> """To the Milliman team’s credit, they did manage to reach and announce the inescapable conclusion that Union County had increased its overall health care expenditure by implementing the direct primary care option. Even then, however, Milliman vastly understated the actual loss. That’s because its employer ROI calculation rested on an estimate of $61 as the average monthly direct primary care fee paid by Union County to Paladina Health; the actual average month fee paid was $95. There had been no need for a monthly fee estimate as the actual fees were a matter of public record. Though $1.25 millions in annual savings had been claimed, the total annual loss by Union County was over $400,000. Though 28% savings had once been bragged, the County’s actual ROI was about —8%. Milliman’s reliance on an estimate of the fees received from the County, rather than the actual fees collected, made a fiscal disaster appear to be close to a break even proposition."""

Age matters though, and it matters a lot. Age-cost curves for health care are steep. In tirades against the Affordable Care Act, many conservatives insist that the costs for 64-year-olds are five times higher than costs for 21-year-olds; that insurance premiums should reflect this 5:1 ratio; and that the 3:1 curve mandated by the Affordable Care Act penalizes the relatively young. [....] The calculations in the op-ed were based on there being a five year age difference between the two groups, my best estimate at the time. Later in 2017, the County advised me that the difference was almost exactly four years. Accordingly, my estimate of net County loss under a 5:1 curve should have been closer to $400,000."""

Null voucher impacts obtained at a lower cost than public schooling may benefit society. The average per-pupil spending in the public school systems in our meta-analysis was higher than the voucher amounts.13 Where the voucher covered the full cost of private school tuition, average school funding in the private versus the public sectors in the same geographic location where the voucher program was implemented was $255 versus $636 for Andhra Pradesh, India; $483 versus $1,963 for Delhi, India; $4,817 versus $11,846 for Milwaukee, WI; $5,456 versus $10,853 for Louisiana; $7,761 versus $21,081 for Washington, DC OSP I; and $12,306 versus $20,577 for Washington, DC OSP II.14 The partial programs in Charlotte, NC; Dayton and Toledo, OH; NYC; Washington, DC; and Bogota, Colombia cost less than half of the per-pupil expenditures in the neighborhood public schools; however, private funds supplemented them. Across the US, in constant 2018–2019 dollars, the per-pupil spending in public schools averaged $14,241 in 2011–2012 while average private school tuition rates were $7,670 in Catholic schools and $9,670 in non-Catholic religious schools (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019a, 2019b).15"""

# construction cannot explain cost increases
construction cannot explain the rise in tuition: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> To get an idea of the maximum impact that the additional borrowing could have on college costs, enrollment at the largest public institutions—approximating the 224 universities and university systems included in the Moody’s data—totaled 10.2 million in fall 2012.25 If all debt service costs were paid for by students, this would yield a figure of $367 per student in increased debt service costs over the past decade. [....] Though we can’t estimate an exact impact on tuition, if we fairly estimate that half of these costs are paid for by students, we find that increased borrowing to fund college construction could account for about 5 percent of the tuition increases over the past decade. Clearly, increased college construction costs are not a major cause of rising tuition.

# state loans cannot explain cost increases [unformatted, reread] (ancap talking point)
increased student aid doesn't correlate with increased tuition: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> The claim that increased student aid causes tuition to rise was originated by William Bennett, the secretary of education under Ronald Reagan, in a 1987 New York Times opinion piece.19 Numerous academic studies since have tested the Bennett hypothesis, and though a few have found some link between rising aid and tuition in at most one sector of higher education,20 the vast majority have “…found not a shred of evidence of an empirical relationship,” as David Warren wrote in the Washington Post.21 As Warren notes, three major federal reports in the last fifteen years have each surveyed the existing academic literature, and each concluded that no such relationship exists. The most recent, conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011, took advantage of a unique “natural experiment” to test the Bennett hypothesis: the substantial increases in Stafford Loan limits between 2007 and 2009.22 In 2007, the yearly loan limits, adjusted for inflation, ranged from $2,925 for freshmen to $6,125 for upper classmen. By 2009, they had risen to $5,750 and $7,825, respectively. All told, the yearly borrowing limit for all undergraduates increased by an average of $2,340. However, average tuition at public 4-year universities rose by just $540 over the same two years, in line with recent historical averages, leading the GAO to reject the possibility of a relationship between the two. Additionally, these increases in borrowing limits were the first since 1993, meaning that the inflation-adjusted value of the limit had declined for more than a decade during which tuitions rose steadily. All told, both the empirical evidence and academic consensus deem the Bennett hypothesis false.

However, the effect is mitigated in the long run as the necessary efficiency improvements are implemented. Thus, consistent with what one might expect, privatization effects grow weaker and become insignificant in the long run (10 years since the reform completion), corroborating the notion that the tradeoffs are felt more acutely in the short to medium term. With the passage of time, companies are able to leverage the incentive improvements associated with the switch to private ownership and compensate for the costs of restructuring. By comparison, in cases where the government did not subsidize heavily prior to privatization, newly privatized firms do not experience the adverse shock of subsidy reduction and instead appear to benefit right away from a switch to private ownership through privatization."""

# fire departments: against privatization
#####o
# note
Some of the main examples cited in favor of privatization are massive, near-monopolistic firms who face little competitive pressure. For example, Denmark's Falck (described as a "business empire") isn't paid by individual consumers, but by municipalities via long-term contracts that cover huge areas, and it provides not just fire but 7 other major public services for ~2/3 of the country. Just as importantly, only one study compares the efficacy of public and private departments -- and that study considered Brazilian jungle fires, where it is not all obvious that the land protected by private and public agencies is similar.

# summary
Lam 2019: fire privatization has several successful and several massively wasteful or destructive case studies: <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-24600-6_8> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/978-3-030-24600-6_8> Public–Private Partnerships for Fire, Police, and Ambulance Services """Privatization attempts such as those in Rye Brook resulted in nearly US$ 1 million in home losses (Henderson 2014). The approaches attempted with varying degrees of success include subscription-based services and municipal contracts.""""""Other PPP types of business model have been tried, e.g., PFI fire stations (below) and the building of nine regional control centers, linked by IT, to replace 46 fire and rescue control rooms spread all over the UK. The latter project was terminated, wasting at least GBP 469 million as a result (elaborated below). Whilst still on the subject of fire protection privatization, the case of Denmark must be mentioned as a successful counter-example. Half of Denmark’s 5 millionplus population has been protected from fire by a private (again international) company since 1922 (Guardiano et al. 1992). As part of an insurance business empire, a group of eight integrated-companies provides firefighting, fire loss prevention, road and air rescue and patient transportation, security guard, and surveillance services. Their crew is trained in multiple rescue functions. Danish law requires a public fire chief to be assigned to each private local fire contractor to ensure compliance with all regulations. The other half of the population is served by a municipal firefighting service or a voluntary fire brigade."""

The number of responses for fire incidents was 13,993, down from 15,332 in 2008."""
Guardiano Haarmeyer Poole 1992: scope of Falck: <https://reason.org/policy-study/fire-protection-privatization/> <https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/files/c2bbfe415eccfdff424a2bf7c8a20585.pdf> Fire Protection Privatization: A Cost-Effective Approach to Public Safety """Falck has 134 stations throughout Denmark all open 24-hours a day. From 106 of these stations, Falcks Redningskorps provides fire services to approximately 2.3 million of the country's inhabitants through contracts with 173 of the total 275 municipalities."""

# private firms often [1] combine full-time and part-time firefighters and [2] use joint production

Of this total, the majority were employed by Falcks Redningskorps in rescue-related work. In addition, to its approximately 2,000 full-time fire fighters, the company employs 1,700 part-time fire fighters.""""""The value of a versatile workforce is especially important in emergency-related services where there is often considerable dead time in between service calls. Instead of having its workforce and equipment idle during these down times, Falck's structure of shared tasks and cross-trained personnel, ensures high productivity of the company's resources. Moreover, as Kristensen pointed out, “Because of its many functions besides fire protection, almost all of its fire stations are manned around the clock.”72 The ability to perform a variety of jobs also gives members of its workforce greater job satisfaction."""

Henderson 2014: two small case studies of privatization going poorly: <https://www.salon.com/2014/05/29/6_things_that_should_never_be_privatized_partner/> """In 1996, the village of Rye Brook, NY (which is about 30 miles from Manhattan) made the mistake of hiring the Rural/Metro Fire Department (a private company) to fight fires—prior to that, firefighter protection in Rye Brook was handled by the fire department of nearby Port Chester, NY. But Rye Brook returned to public-sector firefighting only two years later after a $1 million home was destroyed by fire—perhaps avoidably. Salvatore M. Cresenzi, Rye Brook’s mayor at the time, acknowledged that Rye Brook’s deal with Rural/Metro “was not a success”—and public-sector firefighters’ unions asserted that the home could have been saved had Rural/Metro operated more efficiently in Rye Brook. Seventeen years later in August 2013, there was another horror story involving Rural/Metro—this time in Surprise, Arizona (a Phoenix suburb), where Justin and Kasia Purcell lived in a mobile home. Two weeks after their home burned to the ground, the Purcells received a bill for $19,825 from Rural/Metro because they had not paid the annual subscription Rural/Metro charges for firefighter service in Surprise. But the Purcells told the Huffington Post they had no idea such a service existed and that they would have gladly paid the annual fee had they known."""

# history
crises have always, always, always occurred under capitalism (USA: 1819, 1837, 1839, 1857, 1873, 1884, 1893, 1896, 1907, 1929, 1980, 2007): <https://ideas.repec.org/p/wse/wpaper/52.html> <http://kolegia.sgh.waw.pl/pl/KAE/struktura/IE/struktura/ZES/Documents/Working_Papers/aewp03-11.pdf> """To summarize, the financial crises of the twentieth century were similar to their ancestors. They followed a pattern similar to their nineteenth century counterparts, usually 14 beginning with a speculative bubble, which was followed by a severe stock market crash and a recession. While the response by government has not always been the same, the boom and bust cycle has continued. Some common causes for this cycle include inadequate regulation of the financial sector. Many of these aspects have carried over into the current financial crisis."""

large economic stimulus prevented the 2006-2008 Recession from reducing growth in china -- despite facing the same export crises as Russia and South Africa: <https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/wp/2014/2014-007.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/539255259575615508/unknown.png """Also, total industrial production in China nearly doubled between 2007 and 2013 despite the crisis and an extremely weak international demand for Chinese goods, whereas the United States has experienced zero growth in industrial production and that in the European Union and Japan has declined by 9.3% and 17.1%, respectively. No wonder Chinaís economic growth contributed 50% of global GDP growth during the crisis period (IMF, 2010), even though its income level accounted for less than 10% of world GDP and its total exports have remained 45% below trend since the crisis."""
interest rates can explain just 20% of the 2006 housing crisis: <http://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/679.pdf> """The modest predicted impact of interest rates on prices is in line with empirical estimates, and it suggests that lower real rates can explain only one-fifth of the rise in prices from 1996 to 2006. We also find no convincing evidence that changes in approval rates or loan-to-value levels can explain the bulk of the changes in house prices, but definitive judgments on those mechanisms cannot be made without better corrections for the endogeneity of borrowers’ decisions to apply for mortgages."""

# economic planning: theory on computation and efficiency
#####o
# theory: critiques
the two main critiques of central planning have been 'theoretical incomputability' (computing optimal resource allocation is mathematically impossible) and 'practical incomputability' (insufficient information or computation is available for this problem): <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> 

# theory: theoretical computability (economic calculation problem)
infite possible commodities does not imply uncomputability, as very few possible commodities have nonzero price, inputs, or outputs: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565303895241392128/unknown.png
calculation of an input-output model has a time complexity of n*m*r: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574901351364952064/unknown.png
markets are efficient if and only if P = NP: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2284> """I prove that if markets are weak-form efficient, meaning current prices fully reflect all information available in past prices, then P = NP, meaning every computational problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. I also prove the converse by showing how we can “program” the market to solve NP-complete problems. Since P probably does not equal NP, markets are probably not efficient. Specifically, markets become increasingly inefficient as the time series lengthens or becomes more frequent."""
when companies establish internal markets, they collapse -- for example, Sears was restructured in 2008 and went bankrupt in 2013: <https://www.salon.com/2013/07/18/ayn_rand_killed_sears_partner/> <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-11/at-sears-eddie-lamperts-warring-divisions-model-adds-to-the-troubles>

# theory: practical computability (economic calculation problem)
in practice, planning for economies of modern scale is easily computed even on home computers: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565302380841926656/unknown.png
capitalism can be conceptualized as an iterative input-output model: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> Firms add up wage costs and costs of other commodity inputs, add a markup, and set their prices accordingly. This distributed algorithm, which is nowadays carried out by a combination of people and company computers, is structurally similar to the solution of linear equations by an iterative method. This models one phase of the iterative solution of Sraffa’s equations. Empirical evidence indicates that the price vector upon which the process converges lies somewhere near the vector of labour values see [29, 24].

# theory: natural resources
neither capitalism nor socialism properly 'prices in' finite resources: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> Socialist planners “presumably would have to develop some kind of proxy for the value of nonreproducible resources in units of labour hours. It is difficult to imagine how this could be done in a way that would not be completely arbitrary.” We do not wish to deny there is a problem here. We do, however, find it rather remarkable that Mises (and his expositor, Lavoie) should talk as if the problem solves itself under capitalism. Neither offers any criticism of the classic Ricardian theory, according to which the market price system also fails to take into account non-reproducible resources. For Ricardo, natural resource constraints manifest themselves in the price system via rising marginal cost of production, i.e. just the effect which Mises takes to be inadequate. [....] In fact, matters are not infrequently worse under capitalism. The fact that a certain resource is ultimately exhaustible does not necessarily mean that it is subject to diminishing returns in the short run. In the westward expansion of American agriculture, for instance, the (geographically) marginal land was actually the most productive. In such cases the market provides no incentive whatever for resource conservation; the results were painfully evident in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. We are not claiming that labour-time calculation would necessarily do better in cases where the market fails to conserve resources. We do contend, however, that socialist planners should be able to take more far-sighted decisions on resource conservation than profit-maximizing firms.

# theory: double marginalization
among soda bottling firms, vertical integration across double margins (eg, a bottler bottling both Coke and Pepsi was purchased by Coke and one "double margin" was eliminated) decreased prices: <http://www.law.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/searlecenter/events/antitrust/documents/Luco_Marshall_VISoda_Searle.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574897295972106240/unknown.png We find that vertical integration decreased the prices of own brands bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler by 1.7 percent (e.g., Diet Pepsi bottled by PepsiCo) and it increased the prices of rival brands bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler by 3.9 percent (e.g., Dr Pepper bottled by PepsiCo). The overall impact of vertical integration was to increase the prices of products bottled by vertically-integrated bottlers by 1.6 percent. Dynamic effects estimates show that the price increases in products bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler only started after the vertical transactions took place, and the price increases persisted in time. These results suggest that vertical integration with multiproduct firms has the potential of harming consumers because of how the vertically-integrated multiproduct firms use rival-brand prices to divert demand to their (more profitable to sell) own brands.

# theory: nonhomogenous labor
the value of skilled labor may be calculated as the "labor price" required to produce said skilled labor: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pd> True, labour is not homogeneous, but there is no warrant for the claim that the reduction factor for complex labour has to be arbitrary under socialism. Skilled labour may be treated in the same way that Marx treats the means of production in Capital, namely as a produced input which ‘transfers’ embodied labour to its product over time. Given the labour time required to produce skills and a depreciation horizon for those skills, one may calculate an implied ‘rate of transfer’ of the labour time embodied in the skills. If we call this rate, for skill i, ri , then labour of this type should be counted as a multiple (1 + ri) of simple labour, for the purpose of ‘costing’ its products. Of course the labour input required for the production of skills is likely to be a mixture of skilled and simple, which complicates the calculation of the skill multipliers. An iterative procedure is needed: first calculate the transfer rates as if all inputs were simple labour, then use those first-round transfer rates to re-evaluate the skilled labour inputs, on this basis recompute the transfer rates, and so on, until convergence is reached.

# theory: labor vouchers
Marx 1875: under socialism ("lower phase of communism"), laborers ("individual producers") should receive labor vouchers based on time worked (after deduction "for the communal fund") and use them to pay for means of consumption: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Marx_Critque_of_the_Gotha_Programme.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it. What he has given it is his individual quantum of labour. For instance, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work. The individual labour time of the individual producer thus constitutes his contribution to the social working day, his share of it. Society gives him a certificate stating that he has done such and such an amount of work (after the labour done for the communal fund has been deducted), and with this certificate he can withdraw from the social supply of means of consumption as much as costs an equivalent amount of labour."""
^ Marx 1875: justification for labor vouchers: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Marx_Critque_of_the_Gotha_Programme.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form."""
labor vouchers: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> The labour certificates Marx talks of here are quite different from money. They do not circulate, rather they are cancelled against the acquisition of consumer goods of equivalent labour content. And they may be used for consumer goods alone; they cannot purchase means of production or labour power, and hence cannot function as capital.

It is conceivable that larger firms may tend to focus on innovations with a higher market value.

# canadian pharmaceuticals spend proportionally more on r&d
pharmaceutical companies in Canada spend 1-2x more on research and development than on advertising: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5848527/> Depending on the method used to determine promotion spending, industry-wide the ratio of R&D spending to promotion ranges from 1.45 to 2.18 (sales representatives and journal advertising only) or from 0.88 to 1.32 (total promotion spending estimated based 2003-2005 data.) For the individual companies promoting one or more of the 50 most promoted drugs, 2.11 to 2.32 times more is spent on R&D compared to promotion. However these results should be interpreted cautiously because of data limitations.

(IMS does not provide any comparable values.) With about 700,000 practicing physicians in the US in 2004 [20], we estimate that with a total expenditure of US$57.5 billion, the industry spent around US$61,000 in promotion per physician. **As a percentage of US domestic sales of US$235.4 billion [21], promotion consumes 24.4% of the sales dollar versus 13.4% for R&D.**

[....] During this period, the FDA approved 1541 new-drug applications but granted priority review to just 348 applications (22.6%) (Table 2). **Of the 1541 total approvals, 143 (9.3%) resulted from PSRIs. However, of the 348 priority reviews, 66 (19.0%) resulted from PSRIs, or twice the overall rate for priority reviews.

Cooperatives are low-profile but powerful economic actors, with the world's 300 largest ones generating revenues in 2008 of more than $1.6 trillion. [....] [T]he cooperative model is widespread and by at least one measure surpasses shareholder corporations: the 1 billion member-owners of cooperatives worldwide exceed the 893 million shareholders of corporations. The latter figure includes direct shareholders, who own stock as individuals, and indirect shareholders, who own stock through mutual funds and other indirect vehicles. If individual stockholders are considered alone, cooperative member-owners outnumber direct shareholders three to one.

By contrast, average values of output per log input (material productivity) are usually higher for the co-ops and the unionized mills and lowest for the classical mills. This implies quite different labor-log ratios as shown in the last line: computed over all production types, the average ratio of worker-hours to log inputs in cooperative and unionized mills is more than double its value in classical mills. These differences in input ratios are less marked in mills specializing in plywood and in veneer production. Output per size of largest lathe (XIK) is consistently highest among the unionized mills and usually lowest among the classical mills.""""""Craig and Pencavel conclude, "Worker participation has neither major efficiency gains nor efficiency losses." I found this conclusion rather bold given the imprecision of the estimates. Moreover, a 14 percent increase in productivity could be considered a major gain.

Olsen 2013 argues that "financing constraints" because of lender reluctance and lack of collateral and "elevated early risk" because firms are usually entirely worker-funded (ie, high liability) cause cooperatives to be formed less than conventional enterprises: <https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/article-olsen.pdf>

# safety
right to work laws directly increase occupational deaths: <https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2018/06/13/oemed-2017-104747> Methods Two-way fixed effects regression models are used to estimate the effect of unionisation on occupational mortality per 100 000 workers, controlling for state policy liberalism and workforce composition over the period 1992–2016. In the final specification, RTW laws are used as an instrument for unionisation to recover causal effects. Results The Local Average Treatment Effect of a 1% decline in unionisation attributable to RTW is about a 5% increase in the rate of occupational fatalities. In total, RTW laws have led to a 14.2% increase in occupational mortality through decreased unionisation.

In countries with robust EPL, unemployment scarring is largely insensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions. By contrast, in countries with weaker EPL, unemployment scarring is cyclical and becomes larger as macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. In a country with weak EPL, it makes a big difference whether workers lose a job in a context of rising unemployment or not.

Therefore, given my estimates by income group, the overall impact of a tax cut of 1 percent of GDP that goes half to the bottom 90 percent and half to the top 10 percent will have roughly a $63,000 cost per job."""

Since then, offshore deposits by nonbanks nearly doubled from 2004 to December 2007, when the global economy took a tumble. During that period, offshore financial assets may have grown to be worth as much as $22 to 33 trillion. Since then the model indicates that they have slumped slightly to the $21 trillion to $32 trillion range, with a plausible midpoint of about $26 trillion. But this still represents enough growth since 2004 to be consistent with the growth in global private banking AUMs noted above. Assuming a developing country wealth share of 25 to 30 percent, this range is also consistent with the results of our accumulated wealth model."""

Spain abolished its wealth tax on January 1, 2009, but then re-introduced it in 2012. Austria and Denmark discontinued their wealth tax in 1995, Germany in 1997, Finland and Luxembourg in 2006, and Sweden in 2007. Iceland abrogated its wealth tax in 2006, reintroduced it in 2010 for four years, and then eliminated it in 2015.

One can think of the backlash on taxes in general that began with Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s. This was followed by a conservative backlash in continental Europe in the 1990s and 2000s. For example, the conservative government elected to power in Sweden in the mid-2000s engineered the elimination of both the direct wealth tax and the inheritance tax."""

The first reason is that wealth taxes have failed in Europe. Indeed, eight of the twelve European countries with a wealth tax in 1990 had abandoned them by 2019. Saez and Zucman argue that the wealth tax repeals in Europe were the result of poor policy choices. For example, European wealth taxes were levied on households with little cash but substantial illiquid wealth due to low exemption thresholds. To avoid this problem, Saez and Zucman advocate for a high exemption threshold. The authors note that the exemption threshold in Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal—which is set at $50 million—is 50 times higher than the typical European wealth tax."""

As shown for example by Johannesen and Zucman (2014), half hearted tax enforcement efforts can be easily circumvented and end up having minimal effects on tax evasion. In contrast, the US has taken a bold step in the enforcement direction with FACTA in 2010 that imposes steep penalties on foreign financial institutions that fail to report accounts of US residents to the US tax authorities (see Zucman, 2015 for a detailed discussion).""""""FATCA follows the route of policing directly foreign financial institutions but with the difficulty that the US tax authorities have less power to audit effectively foreign financial institutions than home financial institutions. Another route is to get foreign governments to share the information they can collect from their financial institutions.

The EU is organized to foster such tax competition. Individual income and wealth taxation depends solely on current residence. Hence, when France had a progressive wealth tax before 2018, moving from Paris to London would extinguish immediately progressive wealth tax liability (except for domestic real estate assets).""""""What is more, EU countries have schemes to lure away the high skill or the wealthy from their home countries by promising tax breaks to movers. Contrast this with US policy: US citizens remain liable for US income taxes for life and regardless of residence (but with full credit for foreign income taxes paid). The only way to escape the US income tax is to renounce US citizenship and even then, the US imposes a substantial exit tax. The exit tax, formally known as the expatriation tax, is essentially a tax on all unrealized capital gains upon expatriation. It applies to high income (incomes over $160,000) or high wealth (wealth above $2 million) expatriates. It applies to citizens who renounce citizenship and also to long-term residents who end their US resident tax status. The wealth tax proposal by Elizabeth Warren proposes to further strengthen the exit with a 40% wealth tax on expatriates’ assets.

# summary
Austrian economists routinely assert that we should prefer "praxeology" (ie, deductive "logic" about how they think humans behave) over statistical measures of how humans actually behave (ex: behavioral economics).

# Friedman quote on praxeology

[....] Because his fundamental idea was that we knew things about "human action" (the title of his famous book) because we are human beings. As a result, he argued, we have absolutely certain knowledge of motivations of human action and he maintained that we can derive substantive conclusions from that basic knowledge. Facts, statistical or other evidence cannot, he argued, be used to test those conclusions, but only to illustrate a theory. They cannot be used to contradict a theory, because we are not generalizing from observed evidence, but from innate knowledge of human motives and behavior. That philosophy converts an asserted body of substantive conclusions into a religion."""

# Mises quote: rejecting the idea of empirical testing
Mises 1963: Mises asserted that praxeology was un-empirical, un-testable, and un-verifiable: <https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/638> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782272708162748417/mises1963.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1142624169088008433/image.png """In the field of human history a limitation similar to that which the experimentally tested theories enjoin upon the attempts to interpret and elucidate individual physical, chemical, and physiological events is provided by praxeology. Praxeology is a theoretical and systematic, not a historical, science. Its scope is human action as such, irrespective of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of the concrete acts. Its cognition is purely formal and general without reference to the material content and the particular features of the actual case. It aims at knowledge valid for all instances in which the conditions exactly correspond to those implied in its assumptions and inferences. Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori. They are not subject to verification or falsification on the ground of experience and facts. They are both logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts. They are a necessary requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events. Without them we should not be able to see in the course of events anything else than kaleidoscopic change and chaotic muddle."""

# Mises quote: rejecting actual empirical testing
Mises 1963: Mises famously rejected statistical measures of economic performance in general: <https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/730> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782272708162748417/mises1963.pdf> """In the field of praxeology and economics no sense can be given to the notion of measurement. In the hypothetical state of rigid conditions there are no changes to be measured. In the actual world of change there are no fixed points, dimensions, or relations which could serve as a standard. The monetary unit's purchasing power never changes evenly with regard to all things vendible and purchasable. The notions of stability and stabilization are empty if they do not refer to a state of rigidity and its preservation. However, this state of rigidity cannot even be thought out consistently to its ultimate logical consequences; still less can it be realized."""

In periods of inflation and consequently of sharp price changes they provide a rough image of events which every individual experiences in his daily life. A judicious housewife knows much more about price changes as far as they affect her own household than the statistical averages can tell. She has little use for computations disregarding changes both in quality and in the amount of goods which she is able or permitted to buy at the prices entering into the computation. If she "measures" the changes for her personal appreciation by taking the prices of only two or three commodities as a yardstick, she is no less "scientific" and no more arbitrary than the sophisticated mathematicians in choosing their methods for the manipulation of the data of the market."""

# Murphy, Barnett, and Block 2010 quote: economic theory is geometry!

Rather, they are aspects of praxeology, and, as such, can only be illustrated, not tested. For praxeologists, economic theories are equivalent to mathematical or geometrical claims, such as the Pythagorean Theorem, or to the assertion that the three angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees. One can indeed illustrate such declarations, but it would be meaningless to even attempt to test them. Young in this regard points to the “unwillingness of the ‘Austrian school’ to pursue econometrics.” But Austrians are by no means “unwilling” to pursue econometrics; there are numerous praxeological publications that utilize such statistical techniques. All of them, however, illustrate, but do not purport to test, economic law."""
Young's response explains that even if Austrian logical claims follow qualitatively, they cannot explain magnitude quantitatively: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11138-010-0126-0> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007%2Fs11138-010-0126-0> """I never claim that the results in Young (2005) reject ABCT qualitatively. Quite the opposite: I report “a statistically significant, Hayekian allocative channel for monetary policy” (Young 2005, p. 281). However, I additionally claim that the “results suggest that Hayek’s theory [is] operative but lack[s] economic significance” (p. 275). Concluding that ABCT is not associated with economically significant effects (i.e., does not account for a large portion of reallocation’s variance) is a statement outside of the realm of pure theory.""""""Once it is accepted that quantitative, economic importance is something that pure theory can not speak to directly, quibbling about whether econometrics (or economic history) is testing or illustrating is an unfruitful exercise in semantics."""
Murphy, Barnett, Block 2010b repeat this claim in Section 4, where they also make several empirical claims and assert that they follow "apodictically" from praxeology: <https://ideas.repec.org/a/rau/journl/v7y2012i3p7-20.html> <http://www.rebe.rau.ro/RePEc/rau/journl/FA12/REBE-FA12-A1.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/725732463879520356/murphy2010b.pdf> """Since Young (2010) appears interested in economic praxeological laws that are qualitative, not quantitative, here are a few, provided by Hoppe (1995): [....] Or as another example: Whenever minimum wage laws are enforced that require wages to be higher than existing market wages, involuntary unemployment will result.""" (note: Young was specifically asking for quantitative statements lol)

# Vedder 1997 quote: if the theory's prediction is at odds with the stats, the stats are wrong!

The rate of growth in aggregate prices over time, then, would equal that growth necessary to be consistent with this Austrian proposition. If Bosh's 1.1 point adjustment to the CPI leads to wage growth exceeding productivity change, while no adjustment leads to productivity changes exceeding wage growth, the correct adjustment is one that equates these two measures, perhaps 0.5 or 0.7 percentage points."""
Vedder 1997 claims that free markets are by definition economically efficient; therefore, measuring them isn't worth the time: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02538485> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/BF02538485> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782295071520718848/vedder1997.pdf> """Even accepting the dominant method of modern economics, and believing that the use of empirical means to verify or falsify economic hypotheses is valid, the reality of data aggregation problems makes empirical exercises a hazardous and often dubious enterprise. On basic theoretical grounds, the problems of generalizing with any precision about the magnitude of price changes are substantial. In Rothbard's (1993) "evenly rotating economy" with freely operating market forces, the issue of aggregate economic performance is one that is either irrelevant or of a second order of importance. If economic agents are freely expressing their economic will in their decision making, the existing level of economic performance is optimal, and whether it is larger or smaller than in other time periods is not very important."""

According to the Austrians, the boom is characterized not only by an increase in aggregate production but also by a distortion of the structure of production. Once the errors are realized, a recession follows: aggregate production declines as the structure of production is repaired."""

# structural analysis: young 2012
Kuehn 2013: reviewing Young 2012 <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> The most sophisticated empirical research on Hayekian business-cycle theory to date is offered by Andrew Young (2012), who develops a measure of the length of the capital structure rather than relying on qualitative industrial or process classifications. He estimates the position of an industry in the capital structure with the total industry output requirement (TIOR), or the gross value of all other industries’ output required by an industry to generate one dollar’s worth of that industry’s final good. Industries that fall relatively early in the capital structure will use fewer inputs to produce their (gross) output, and so they will have a lower measured TIOR. Using this method, Young (2012) calculates the TIOR for sixty-five industries, and determines that the aggregated length of the capital structure measured using his methods is pro-cyclical and closely correlated with the federal funds rate from 1998 to 2009, as Hayekian theory suggests. One problem with this measure that Young (2012) points out is that it is not clear how much meaning can be ascribed to a given change in the TIOR. From 2008 to 2009, the aggregate TIOR fell from about 1.8 to a little over 1.7. Is this a large change or a small one? Does it matter for macroeconomic fluctuations? At this point, it is difficult to say. If nothing else, the empirical work suggests that Kaldor (1942, 363) was quite wrong in dismissing the lengthening of the structure of production as “one of those blind alleys of economic speculation which appear very suggestive for a time, but whose significance evaporates as soon as one tries to fit the theoretical conclusions more closely to the observed phenomena.” The theoretical discussion fits the best analyses of the observed phenomena quite well. Questions remain, however, about the strength of the Hayekian mechanisms or their significance for the business cycle.

Friedman found that in a data series going back to the late nineteenth century recession depths were correlated with the subsequent boom and not the prior boom. He called this the “plucking model” because it implied that recessions were caused by plucking the economy down from an otherwise steady growth path. In many ways, Friedman’s simple empirical exercise offers the greatest blow to Hayek of all the criticisms discussed here. A theory of the unsustainable boom is of little use if busts are not caused by booms."""

# empirics: monetary policy should predict recessions (it doesn't)
Kuehn 2013: Hayekian theory poorly predicts recessions; neither tight or loose monetary policy, relative to the "natural" rate of interest, consistently precedes or postcedes recessions: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553974446269136914/unknown.png Figure 2, below, subtracts the real federal funds rate from this estimated natural rate. If this difference is equal to zero, then the actual federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve is equal to the best estimate of the natural rate of interest, and monetary policy is neutral. A positive value for the difference indicates tight monetary policy, while a negative value indicates loose monetary policy. Vertical lines are provided to indicate the start date of recessions, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. [....] The recessions of the 1960s and 1970s at least have the virtue of exhibiting the pro-cyclical (albeit persistently loose) monetary stance required by Hayek. Far less is available for Austrians to work with in the case of the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, which were not preceded by any monetary loosening at all. Regardless of the actual level of the real interest rate, if this rate is not below the natural rate – if monetary policy is not expansionary – there can be no unsustainable boom according to Hayekian business cycle theory. [....] Hayekians who think that the capital structure lengthens and contracts with the price signals sent by monetary policy are confronted with an awkward question: exactly what were entrepreneurs doing between 2005-06 and 2008? [....] Given the weak evidence for Hayek’s unsustainable boom, it seems far more plausible that Keynesian (or monetarist) forces drive the business cycle, and that the capital structure – behaving in an otherwise purely Hayekian manner – lengthens and contracts as a consequence the of the business cycle, rather than as its cause.

# empirics: relative intermediate prices should decrease (they don't)
Luther 2014: ABCT predicts that an increase in interest rates should cause crude and finished goods to increase in both quantity and price relative to intermediate goods: for both price and quantity and crude and finished goods, empirical results are statistically insignificant and opposite in sign to these predictions: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11293-014-9415-5> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/s11293-014-9415-5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/725726136402706442/luther2014.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553983169938849793/unknown.png """If the Austrian view is empirically relevant, the authors surmise, a positive monetary shock should increase the production and prices of goods at early and late stages relative to the production and prices of goods at middle stages.""""""With the exception of early- to middle-stage prices, which responded positively to the productivity gap but negatively to TGt, the responses depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 are qualitatively similar. For the most part, the responses of the four ratios are small, statistically insignificant, and of the opposite sign as that predicted by the Austrian theory. From this, we conclude that our results are robust to selection of a measure of the natural rate and, accordingly, are more confident in our assessment that the available data provides little empirical support for the Austrian business cycle theory.

# empirics: investment should go down when consumption goes up (it's the opposite)
Kuehn 2013: Hayekian theory predicts that consumption and investment move oppositely; they move together: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> Cowen (1997) points out that over the business cycle, investment and consumption move together, a phenomenon he refers to as “co-movement”. [...] Hayek’s theory predicts that investment and consumption should move in opposite directions over the business cycle[.] [...] First, Prices and Production assumed that the economy starts in a position of full employment before the unsustainable boom begins. [...] [S]ince the economy is operating at capacity any increase in capital goods production has to come at the expense of consumer goods production. [...] [Second,] the upper-turning point [...] accounts for the end of the boom with the Ricardian assumption that capital intensification occurs at the expense of labor income, and that this tension between capital and labor ends the boom. [....] Garrison (2000, 2004) provides a supply-side response by assuming that capital intensive production processes are more productive than labor intensive production processes, so the move to capital intensive processes can accommodate a simultaneous increase in consumption and investment. [....] Hayek clearly expected a movement of consumption and investment in opposite directions: “an increase in the demand for consumer goods will tend to decrease rather than increase the demand for investment goods” [...] [I]f Garrison [...] is accurate, it is not clear what needs to be rebalanced in a market correction (i.e., a recession). [...] [T]he upper turning point occurred precisely because of this tension between consumption and investment. If that tension is explained away [...] then [...] the inevitable bust is explained away as well.

# empirics: businesses should vary daily behavior with interest rates (they don't)
Kuehn 2013: Hayekian theory ignores the fact that businesses largely ignore the interest rate for day-to-day operations: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/08913811.2013.853863> A more substantial rebuttal to Hayek’s concerns about a distorted capital structure is offered by Tullock (1987), who objects to the whole idea that firms care much about interest rates in determining the volume of production. Hayek’s theory requires that an artificially low interest rate makes production that takes a longer time more profitable than it otherwise would be, but if interest costs are not even considered by firms the whole theory falls apart. [....] He further noted that the reason why firms ignore interest rates in production decisions is that even highly capital intensive production processes (after all capital equipment has been acquired and installed) do not usually take a substantial amount of time to complete. Tullock’s experience with interest rates anticipates a finding by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000) that as long as inflation is modest, firms ignore it in their decision making. Although entrepreneurial responses to interest rate variations (in Tullock’s case) or low inflation (in Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry’s case) need not be identical, the common conclusion of this and other behavioral research seems to be that these sorts of minor costs are discounted in the decision making process relative to larger concerns. If interest rates and inflation fail to drive distortionary production decisions it is hard to see why a market correction would be inevitable or even necessary. Interest rates are still critical for large capital expenditures, but the widely cited empirical work of Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) suggests that most job creation and destruction happens at large, mature establishments which are presumably primarily making capacity utilization decisions rather than new capital expenditure decisions.

Rothbard's ethical framework grants ownership of children to its parents; children gain legal autonomy only once they run away from their parent's home: <https://mises.org/library/children-and-rights> <https://u1lib.org/book/1670179/9283e5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782293106594152490/rothbard1998.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/885694764589137970/unknown.png """The mother, then, becomes at the birth of her child its "trustee-owner," legally obliged only not to aggress against the child's person, since the child possesses the potential for self-ownership. Apart from that, so long as the child lives at home, it must necessarily come under the jurisdiction of its parents, since it is living on property owned by those parents. Certainly the parents have the right to set down rules for the use of their home and property for all persons (whether children or not) living in that home. But when are we to say that this parental trustee jurisdiction over children shall come to an end? Surely any particular age (21,18, or whatever) can only be completely arbitrary. The clue to the solution of this thorny question lies in the parental property rights in their home. For the child has his full rights of self-ownership when he demonstrates that he has them in nature — in short, when he leaves or "runs away" from home. Regardless of his age, we must grant to every child the absolute right to run away and to find new foster parents who will voluntarily adopt him, or to try to exist on his own. Parents may try to persuade the runaway child to return, but it is totally impermissible enslavement and an aggression upon his right of self-ownership for them to use force to compel him to return. The absolute right to run away is the child's ultimate expression of his right of self-ownership, regardless of age."""

# free baby market
Rothbard therefore proposes that parents may freely trade their children: <https://mises.org/library/children-and-rights> <https://u1lib.org/book/1670179/9283e5> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782293106594152490/rothbard1998.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/885695085898006559/unknown.png """Now if a parent may own his child (within the framework of non-aggression and runaway freedom), then he may also transfer that ownership to someone else. He may give the child out for adoption, or he may sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract. In short, we must face the fact that the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children. Superficially, this sounds monstrous and inhuman. But closer thought will reveal the superior humanism of such a market. For we must realize that there is a market for children now, but that since the government prohibits sale of children at a price, the parents may now only give their children away to a licensed adoption agency free of charge.10 This means that we now indeed have a child-market, but that the government enforces a maximum price control of zero, and restricts the market to a few privileged and therefore monopolistic agencies. The result has been a typical market where the price of the commodity is held by government far below the free-market price: an enormous "shortage" of the good. The demand for babies and children is usually far greater than the supply, and hence we see daily tragedies of adults denied the joys of adopting children by prying and tyrannical adoption agencies. In fact, we find a large unsatisfied demand by adults and couples for children, along with a large number of surplus and unwanted babies neglected or maltreated by their parents. Allowing a free market in children would eliminate this imbalance, and would allow for an allocation of babies and children away from parents who dislike or do not care for their children, and toward foster parents who deeply desire such children. Everyone involved: the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing the children, would be better off in this sort of society.11"""

# summary of personal finance self-help
Olen 2012: why self-help financial advice has taken off with little critique: <https://u1lib.org/dl/2167556/aa02b0?convertedTo=pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/805901035691835492/olen2012.pdf> """By 1999, financial services advertising would be responsible for almost a third of newspaper ad monies, though how these dollars were distributed through the media universe would shift as the Internet assumed increasing prominence. In 2002, financial advertising would total $5.9 billion, rising to $8.8 billion in 2010, and just under $9.1 billion in 2011. In fact, Nielsen found that the top increases in promotional spending by category for the first part of 2011 were in automobile insurance, bank services, and financial investment services—all financially oriented categories. So, instead of freeing publishers and station managers from the tyranny of complaints from the auto, real estate, and retail industries, the emphasis on personal finance ultimately created yet another powerful advertising client base that would need to be appeased. As a result, it became increasingly difficult to rock the boat by questioning the assumptions behind much of the financial information presented, rendering much of the advice glib at best and suspect at worst."""

# asymmetric information in insurance markets
insurance markets with asymmetric information and two types of consumers (high-risk and low-risk) result in an externality in which low-risk consumers under-purchase insurance: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122148507500243> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/B978-0-12-214850-7.50024-3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/738068647934820355/unknown.png

Their sample was 2286 seniors from the 2002 Health and Retirement Study. Using the PC test, they found strong evidence for asymmetric information (and adverse selection) in favor of the purchase of Medigap plans. (Riskier individuals bought more coverage.) However, using their multivariate PC model, they found that this correlation varied significantly across personal demographics. For example, they found that people with higher cognitive abilities were more likely to purchase Medigap plans but less likely to use the hospital than their peers. This suggests that people with higher cognitive abilities are advantageously selecting into the plan: even those who don’t “need” the insurance (as much as their peers) are buying into it.

Their sample was 92725 people from a survey conducted by JD Power and Associates about insurance plans. Using the simple PC model, Sirmans found a strong negative correlation between risk and deductibles size (higher risk – smaller deductibles) and strong positive correlation between risk and premium (higher risk – higher premiums). Both of these suggest that adverse selection is occurring. Interestingly, they found no evidence that the proportion of people in a state in a group insurance plan -- which should reduce adverse selection -- was associated with adverse selection.

summary: Racialism, "scientific racism", and "race realism" describe the belief that human population groups have large, socially-important differences in phenotypes caused by differences in frequencies of genes. Scientific consensus and scientific evidence support scientific anti-racism, the position that genetic differences cause few socially-important differences between human populations.

# summary
Scientific racists constantly try to claim that their views are mainstream science, but are repressed by informal taboos on their research or formal institutional censorship of their views. In reality, scientific racist views are a small minority that frequently publishes and receives extensive media coverage (suggesting the "taboo" is not real).

Although there are clear observable correlations between variation in the human genome and how individuals identify by race, the study of human genetics challenges the traditional concept of different races of humans as biologically separate and distinct. This is validated by many decades of research, including recent examples. Most human genetic variation is distributed as a gradient, so distinct boundaries between population groups cannot be accurately assigned. There is considerable genetic overlap among members of different populations. Such patterns of genome variation are explained by patterns of migration and mixing of different populations throughout human history. In this way, genetics exposes the concept of “racial purity” as scientifically meaningless.

. Specifically, one needs to understand that the causes of within-group variation in a trait can be different from the causes of between-group variation in that same trait. That is, even when trait differences between individuals within a population are entirely inherited, differences between populations can still be caused entirely by environmental factors (Feldman & Lewontin, 1975).

The combined contribution of all of these genomic variants to any group level difference in a complex human trait is predicted to be small, possibly spurious, and largely dependent on the environment according to population genetic theory (Rosenberg et al., 2018). <https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/26/5262222>
Empirically, we also know that intergenerational scores on IQ tests have changed over time because of improvements in the human environment <https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1718793115>
To claim that racial disparities in education are caused by genetic differences between races on the basis of heritability statistics that are derived within populations, as Jensen (1969) did, is at best a conceptual error (Feldman & Lewontin, 1975), and at worst, an ideological distortion of scientific knowledge (Donovan, 2015a; Graves, 2015; Lewontin, 1996) that is not supported by contemporary population genetic theory on polygenic trait variation <https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2019/1/26/5262222>

Obviously, this does not imply that genetic discontinuities do not exist on a more local scale, for example, between people from different linguistic groups (e.g., Barbujani and Sokal 1990; Sokal et al. 1990). It also does not mean that no differences whatsoever exist between continental groups. In fact, what Rosenberg et al. (2002) have shown is that given enough markers and the extraordinary power of Structure, the tiny amounts of genetic differences that exist between continents can also be discerned. However, this should not obscure the fact that on a worldwide scale, clines are a better representation of the human diversity than clades, and that continents do not represent more substantial discontinuities in such clines than many other geographical and cultural barriers.

# variation: most SNP alleles are present in most populations (but not all are!)
the vast majority (86%) of SNPs in the average human's genome are common among all humans population groups ("cosmopolitan"): 84.7 million SNPs, 3.6 million short indels, 60k structural variants (>99% of SNPs with frequency >1%): <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1038/nature15393> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/511289755938455563/unknown.png """Although most common variants are shared across the world, rarer variants are typically restricted to closely related populations (Fig. 1a); 86% of variants were restricted to a single continental group.""""""The majority of variants in the data set are rare: ~64 million autosomal variants have a frequency <0.5%, ~12 million have a frequency between 0.5% and 5%, and only ~8 million have a frequency >5% (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, the majority of variants observed in a single genome are common: just 40,000 to 200,000 of the variants in a typical genome (1–4%) have a frequency <0.5% (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3b)."""

# variation: fst
2010 review: humans have a low F_st value: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952510000788> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/541320761307168768/unknown.png More recent work suggests that the human species’ FST could actually be lower, between 0.05 and 0.13 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 for autosomal SNPs (Table 1), in other words between one-third and one-half of that observed in gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; FST = 0.38 [28]) and between Western and Eastern chimpanzee (FST = 0.32 [15]) despite humans occupying a much broader geographic area [29]. In short, not only do humans show the lowest species diversity among primates [30] but are also subdivided into populations that are more closely related than any other primate species, with the possible exception of bonobos (Pan paniscus) [18]. [....] The limited degree of differentiation among human populations does not suggest a history of long-term isolation and differentiation, but rather that genome variation was mostly shaped by our comparatively recent origin from a small number of founders 32, 33 who dispersed to colonize the whole planet 34, 35.
isolation by distance explains most human variation: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756148/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564359627832033311/unknown.png [T]he emerging scientific consensus is that while isolation by distance explained a large proportion of human population pair-wise Fst-values, cluster, the computational placeholder for race, explained <2% (Rosenberg et al., 2005; Handley et al., 2007). Thus, the indistinctiveness Fst-value argument, as construed here against the idea of biological reality of human races, is not simply about crude Fst measures. It also takes into consideration the part of Fst quantitatively explained by cluster/race (Table ​(Table2).2). So it goes beyond Wright's qualitative guideline about the use of Fst. The argument thus has two quantitative components, the unadjusted Fst-values and the adjusted values of cluster/race covariate. It can thus be considered the quantitative equivalent of the qualitative argument of “lack of distinction” Darwin used to question the taxonomic wisdom of categorizing humans into races in natural classification since the categories cannot be objectively defined (Maglo, 2011).

# genetic identification has low importance
being able to identify races from genetic variation doesn't mean that that genetic variation is meaningful: <http://www.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7312/columbia/9780231156974.001.0001/upso-9780231156974-chapter-8> """The largest misconception of this approach is that it ignores the fact that isolation by distance explains the vast majority of variation in human allele frequencies. Thus, 75 percent of human allele frequency variation is explained by geographic distance. This means that it is possible to produce the appearance of clustering simply by where one samples genetic variation. Serre and Paabo demonstrated that heterogeneous sampling gave rise to genetic clusters that were biologically meaningless. This is precisely what is occurring in biomedical research in the United States."""
just because we can identify something doesn't mean it's biologically important: Leslie 2015 divided Britain into >10 different genetic groups based on recent (<1000yr) migrations, but different British populations do not seem meaningfully different: <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14230> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564361049546162176/nature14230-f1.png

# genetic identification is valid
we can identify various genetic clusters (for any arbitary number of clusters): <https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010070> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/721804792166350878/unknown.png
racial populations can be very accurately identified using large numbers of common SNPs (2C, error ~.12%); however, using larger numbers of races (2D, ~3%) or intermixed populations (2E, ~10%) significantly increases error: <https://www.genetics.org/content/176/1/351> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1534/genetics.106.067355> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/726062602337124392/F2.png """[T]he answer to the question “How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?” depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity and the populations being compared. The answer, ω can be read from Figure 2.""""""The effect of population sampling becomes more pronounced when ≥1000 loci are available. In the microarray data set, Math drops to zero at 1000 loci if only distinct populations are sampled. With geographically intermediate and admixed populations added, however, Math reaches an asymptotic value of 3.1%, CC remains well above zero, and even CT does not reach zero (microarray data, Figure 2, C and D; Table 1)."""
categorization based on ancestry outperforms categorization based on race: <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01837-7> Our findings indicate that ancestry cross-classifies ethno-linguistic group as well as continent and race. To expound this point, Western Asian ancestry currently exists at its highest frequency in peoples from the Caucasus Mountains and the Levant and is the major ancestry in Abkhazian, Georgian, and Druze samples. Yet, significant amounts of Western Asian ancestry are present in samples with origins ranging from Morocco to Mongolia and from England to Ethiopia. That is, Western Asian ancestry simultaneously exists in Africa, Asia, and Europe, as well as in the US racial categories Black or African American, Asian, and White. Thus, in contrast to race, ancestry is a valid genomic classifier.

Data were collated for latitude, prevalence of harmful parasites, mean annual temperature, and variation in annual temperature for the location of 175 hominid crania dating from 1.9 million to 10 thousand years ago. We also included a proxy for population density and two indexes of paleoclimatic variability for the time at which each cranium was discovered. Results revealed independent contributions of population density, variation in paleoclimate, and temperature variation to the prediction of change in hominid cranial capacity (CC). **Although the effects of paleoclimatic variability and temperature variation provide support for climatic hypotheses, the proxy for population density predicted more unique variance in CC than all other variables. The pattern suggests multiple pressures drove hominid brain evolution and that the core selective force was social competition.** [....] The third panel shows a similar relationship between temperature variation and CC; as temperature variation increases to the mean of this variable, CC increases. However, at approximately 0.5 SD from the mean or higher, increases in temperature variation are associated with decreases in CC. The amplitude of this function is less than 200 cm3.

This “dysgenic” theory has been framed primarily with respect to cognitive ability (32).""""""For example, although the less educated respondents in the population have a fairly stable number of offspring over the birth cohorts, those with greater observed (i.e., phenotypic) education levels have fewer children over time. A similar pattern can be observed for height where only in more recent birth cohorts do we see those with higher stature having fewer children. Both of these phenotypic trends would seem to imply dynamics of emergent or strengthening dysgenic reproductive patterns. However, when we look at the relevant genetic scores in Fig. 2C, we find that the dysgenic trends inferred from phenotypic associations between education and height on the one hand, and fertility on the other, are not present with respect to the genotypic data. [....] Although we may recall from Fig. 2A that the PGSs for height and education predict number of children ever born in the overall sample, these associations are consistent across all birth cohorts in this study. Thus, although there may be positive selection on height and slight negative selection on additive measures of the genetic architecture of education, these are not accelerating."""

More importantly, however, model 4 of panel A shows that the interaction between birth year and PGS—the direct test of whether such dynamics are shifting over time as H&M suggest—is insignificant. Therefore, as a society, we do not seem to be experiencing increasing dysgenic dynamics, despite the fears of H&M, among others (Lynn 2011).

While such factors may be present, their influence is negligible compared with other environmental factors. Notably, this goes counter to the conclusion of a recent review on retrograde Flynn effects (6) and the expert opinions reported in a recent survey of intelligence researchers, which found “the anti-Flynn effect being attributed mainly to genetics and immigration” (7). As noted by two of the reviewers, the magnitude of the negative Flynn trend in our data itself speaks against the dysgenic hypothesis for retrograde Flynn effects, as changes in IQ over time are too large to plausibly reflect selection-driven genetic change in the population.""""""Polygenic scores that predict education are correlated with IQ and have been shown to correlate negatively with fertility in Icelandic and US data (16, 17).

These latencies are considerably shorter than those reported in recent SRT studies (Lowe and Rabbitt, 1998; Deary et al., 2001; Deary and Der, 2005; Der and Deary, 2006). Given the correlation between SRTs and fluid intelligence (Deary et al., 2001; Bugg et al., 2006), Woodley et al. (2013) concluded that the slowed SRTs in recent studies reflected a systematic reduction in processing speed, and hence fluid intelligence, in contemporary populations. However, an alternative explanation of the apparent SRT slowing is that the SRT latencies reported in recent studies have been inflated by hardware and software delays in computerbased paradigms (Dordonova and Dordonov, 2013). In support of this argument, contemporary studies using mechanical SRT measurements (Montare, 2010; Eckner et al., 2011), including SRT testing procedures similar to those used by Galton (Dordonova and Dordonov, 2013), report SRT latencies similar to those observed in the Victorian era."""

Laitman 2017: the direct cost of crime is estimated at 3.5% of GDP among Latin American countries; about 1.5% from public spending (ex: prisons), 1.4% from private spending (ex: security guards), 0.6% from social costs of victimization (ex: lost income and quality of life): <https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Costs-of-Crime-and-Violence-New-Evidence-and-Insights-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-(Executive-Summary).pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/873397870684950568/unknown.png """This volume also points out the steep costs of Latin America’s high incarceration rates. For the 2010-2014 period, the region spent $6.5 billion per year to maintain and build prisons. On top of this, imprisoned individuals forgo an additional $7.3 billion annually in income. The two numbers together amount to 0.39 percent of GDP, more than the conditional cash transfers for the region’s poor."""

They also argued that the ultimate causes of crime were similar for both Whites and Blacks, leading to what has been labeled the thesis of “racial invariance.” In light of the large scale social changes of the past two decades and the renewed political salience of race and crime in the United States, this paper reassesses and updates evidence evaluating the theory. In so doing, we clarify key concepts from the original thesis, delineate the proper context of validation, and address new challenges. Overall, we find that the accumulated empirical evidence provides broad but qualified support for the theoretical claims. We conclude by charting a dual path forward: an agenda for future research on the linkages between race and crime, and policy recommendations that align with the theory’s emphasis on neighborhood level structural forces but with causal space for cultural factors."""

No matter what the level of disadvantage or the racial/ethnic composition, neighborhoods are worse off in terms of violent crime when they are located in more segregated cities. But this influence of segregation is not as dramatic as that resulting from differential placement of racial and ethnic groups in the social structure. Clearly, white urban neighborhoods that are actually found in U.S. cities provide distinctly different contexts of local disadvantage and city segregation than is the case for either black or Latino communities. Virtually all black and Latino neighborhoods have higher levels of disadvantage than those found in most white areas. This is seen in the striking pattern whereby predicted violence rates for observed white neighborhoods are almost exclusively in the left half of the disadvantage scale, whereas predicted rates for observed black and Latino neighborhoods are mainly in the right half of the graph."""

For example, in the case of African Americans the violence norms and values grew out of the post-slavery experience of blacks in the South and were perpetuated by the denial of opportunities for social advancement. Fifth, and last, cultural values supporting violence can change when the subcultural group moves into a position in society (such as the middle class in the United States) in which violence is eschewed because it is detrimental to the improved social status of group members. We have seen this development repeatedly in the United States with immigrant groups, such as the Irish of the mid-19th century and the Italians of the early 20th century. Both groups had subcultures of violence which ultimately were abandoned as they advanced to middle class status (Latzer, 2016, pp. 101–02)."""

In theory, this vigilance raises their testosterone (T), which in turn facilitates dominance contests that usually do not but may end violently. Two prior reports, using large datasets, show inordinately high T in young black men with low education, a cohort in which honor culture participants are presumed to be concentrated. However, a third study did not find this effect. Here, using a newer and very large dataset, the combined NHANES surveys from 2013-14 and 2015-16, mean T of young black men with low education is shown to be higher than that of comparable white or Hispanic men. Higher T appears among black males by late teenage. Females do not show the same pattern."""

# evidence for higher or lower testosterone between racial groups is very variable
in a sample of 1881 bostonians, there were no racial differences in testosterone among black, white, and Hispanic people: <https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/91/11/4326/2656429> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542051741018095636/zeg0110646170001.png With or without adjustment for covariates, there were no significant differences in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, or SHBG levels by race/ethnicity. DHEAS levels differed by race/ethnicity before covariate adjustment; after adjustment this difference was attenuated. Before adjustment, DHT and DHT to testosterone ratios did not significantly differ by racial/ethnic group. After adjustment, there was evidence of racial/ethnic differences in DHT (P = 0.047) and DHT to testosterone (P = 0.038) levels. Black men had higher DHT levels and DHT to testosterone ratios than white and Hispanic men.
in a sample of 280, race did not affect testosterone or risk-taking: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453015002024> Because of our predominantly Caucasian samples, any effects of racial differences in testosterone would have to be extremely large to systematically influence our results. Nevertheless, we did examine if differences between Caucasians and non-Caucasians existed for cortisol, testosterone, and our risk-taking measures in each study, but none were found (ps ≥ .380). Furthermore, controlling for whether participants were Caucasian did not alter the significance of our reported Testosterone × Cortisol interactions (ps ≤ .040), and moderated regression analysis testing 3-way Race × Testosterone × Cortisol interactions revealed that Caucasian status did not moderate our reported dual-hormone interactions (ps ≥ .307).
compared to white people, Hispanic people have higher testosterone, black people have higher estradiol (an estrogen): <https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/92/7/2519/2598282> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542035221965438976/unknown.png In conclusion, in this large, nationally representative sample, there was no difference in circulating testosterone concentrations between non-Hispanic black and white men overall. However, black men had the highest estradiol level overall across all ages, which was not explained by racial differences in the prevalence of factors that influence hormone levels. Mexican-American men had hormonal profiles similar to non-Hispanic white men, with the exception of higher testosterone.

# MAOA-uVNTR warrior gene: terminology and overview
MAOA or MAO-A: Monoamine oxidase A helps deaminate ("deactivate") neurologically important amine neurotransmitters including dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine_oxidase_A>
MAOA-uVNTR: the region that regulates MAOA production; has multiple polymorphisms (types); can be shorter (lower-activity) or longer (higher-activity)
rs1465108: Variant 1 of uVNTR
rs909525: Variant 2 of uVNTR
rs2235186: Variant 3 of uVNTR
rs2072743: Variant 4 of uVNTR
rs1137070: Variant 5 of uVNTR
rs3027409: Variant 6 of uVNTR
rs6323: another MAOA polymorphism unrelated to uVNTR
Ficks 2014: summary of how MAOA works and the types of MAOA: TLDR is that 2R, 3R might cause violence, 3.5R and 4R might reduce violence, and 5R is unclear: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9661-y> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/s10519-014-9661-y> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/940005126976991242/ficks2014.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/940013521943531580/7c3bfe6a-8322-4c00-bc7a-1c585a25ac55.png """The MAOA enzyme metabolizes monoamine neurotransmitters, including serotonin (Sabol et al. 1998). The promoter region of MAOA located on the short arm of the X chromosome contains a 30 base pair variable number of tandem repeats sequence (VNTR) consisting of 2, 3, 3.5, 4, or 5 repeated copies (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006; Sabol et al. 1998). Transcription of the 3-repeat (short) allele results in reduced MAOA activity and thus increased serotonin in the synapse, putatively increasing risk for aggression and ASB. The frequency of the ‘‘risk" allele in nonclinical samples of European ancestry ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, although the frequency of this allele in individuals of Asian and African ancestry appears to be substantially higher (*0.6 in both groups; Sabol et al. 1998). In contrast, the 4-repeat (long) allele results in increased MAOA activity and is considered the low-risk allele (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Of the less common alleles, the 3.5- repeat has shown evidence of activity similar to that of the 4-repeat and is thus considered high activity, whereas the 2-repeat is usually grouped with the 3-repeat allele and considered low activity (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Classification of the 5-repeat allele has been inconsistent across studies."""

the difference between atmospheric lead between the least-enleadened and most-enleadened US county predicted 4x higher homicide rates: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/190628> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1001/archpedi.155.5.579> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640930782440849430/unknown.png Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationship between air lead concentrations and the incidence of homicide across counties in the United States (N = 3111). After adjusting for sociologic confounding factors and 9 measures of air pollution, the only indictor of air pollution found to be associated with homicide rates was air lead concentration. Across all counties, estimated air lead concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.17 µg/m3. The adjusted results suggest that the difference between the highest and lowest level of estimated air lead is associated with a homicide incidence rate ratio of 4.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.61).
suburban air lead strongly predicted assault rates in Australia: <https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-016-0122-3> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1186/s12940-016-0122-3> Accounting for socio-demographic covariates, lead in air remained a strong predictor of assault rates. For every additional μg/m3 of lead in air, assault rates 21 years later increased by 163 per 100,000 population (see Table 3). Lead in air was the strongest predictor in the model, accounting for 29.8 % of the variance in assault rates 21 years later. By comparison, the proportion of the population aged 15–24 accounted for 5.4 % of the variance, and the proportion of the population who completed secondary school accounted for 5.0 %.

immigration restrictions in the 1910's and 20's caused the immigrant population to age relative to the native one -- and thus saw a corresponding decline in relative crime: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831353/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542377842701369374/unknown.png By 1930, as shown in the top panel, more than half of the foreign-born population was over the age of 30, and more than 10% were 65 or older. These differences in age distributions can have a profound effect on perceptions of relative criminality because age is so strongly correlated with criminal behavior. Crime rates peak for males in late adolescence and decline rather precipitously thereafter. **Comparisons of native and immigrant criminality in 1930 that do not control for these differences in age distributions will necessarily bias the results in favor of immigrants.**

It wasn’t until Jewish immigrants at the turn of the 20th century adopted the “ultimate city game”—and over the course of a few decades, from the ’20s to the ’50s, added innovations in play and strategy—that it went from one requiring brute strength to one that stressed skill and strategy.

The players then and now were subject to sometimes egregious racial stereotyping. The newest showmen of modern basketball, such as Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant are singled out for their "athleticism" and "natural talents", rather than their well-rounded play. Such stereotypes reflect a long tradition that goes back more than seven decades, when the game emerged from the ghettos of Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore. Sportswriters then used to wax about the gaudy skills of "natural athletes." Sounds familiar, except the stars had names like Dutch Garfinkel and Doc Lou Sugerman, and the top teams were the Philadelphia "Hebrews", the New York Whirlwinds and the Cleveland Rosenblums."""

Muscle fiber types, reflex capabilities, metabolic efficiency, lung capacity and a host of other variables that determine success in the world of sports are clearly not distributed evenly between populations. Biology circumscribes possibility. "Differences among athletes of elite caliber are so small that if you have an advantage that might be genetically based...it might be very, very significant," notes Michigan State University anthropologist Robert Malina, who studied black/white differences in earning his doctorate in anthropology at Penn.

[....] Nevertheless, as we recognised in the protocol,15 some variability in these populations remained, mostly at the extremes of gestational age in some parameters. This variation might have arisen because of residual secular trends, true inter-ethnic diff erences,10 unstable estimations due to the small sample sizes at some gestational age windows, or simply diff erences in protocol implementation despite our best eff orts to standardise rigorously across the study sites. **However, we confirmed that such variability among sites represents only 3% of the total variance for skeletal growth, whereas the variability in individuals within a site is seven times higher (table 3).** [....] These results support pooling of the data for the construction of international standards. The data are in strong agreement with those of the WHO MGRS, and suggest that **differences reported in the scientific literature in fetal growth and newborn size are more likely due to environmental and socioeconomic differences than genetic variation, as has been shown for infants and children.**

Multivariate analysis of craniometric variation shows results similar to those obtained from genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms: roughly 13% of the total diversity is among regions, 6% among local populations within regions, and 81% within local populations. This distribution is concordant with neutral genetic markers. Skin color shows the opposite pattern, with 88% of total variation among regions, 3% among local populations within regions, and 9% within local populations, a pattern shaped by natural selection.

Lynn suggest that penis length and girth are greatest in Negroids (sub-Saharan Africans), intermediate in Caucasoids (Europeans, South Asians and North African), and smallest in Mongoloids (East Asians), but this is based upon studies that did not meet our present inclusion and exclusion criteria. The greatest proportion of the participants in the present meta-analysis were Caucasoids. There was only one study of 320 men in Negroids and two studies of 445 men in Mongoloids. There are no indications of differences in racial variability in our present study, e.g. the study from Nigeria was not a positive outlier. The question of racial variability can only be resolved by the measurements with large enough population being made by practitioners following the same method with other variables that may influence penis size (such as height) being kept constant. Future studies should also ensure they accurately report the race of their participants and conduct inter-rater reliability."""

# genetic testing superior
genetic testing is far superior to ethnicity for providing personalized medicine: <https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/clpt.2008.114> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641983496683782184/cptclpt2008114-fig-0001-m.png Given these trends, race/ethnicity should be considered only a makeshift solution for personalized genomics because it is too approximate; known differences may occur within a defined category. One example of such variability is provided by CYP2D6, which is involved in metabolizing codeine, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The CYP2D6*17 form has moderately lower enzymatic activity than the wild type. However, different populations within Africa can have different frequencies for a variant. The *17 allele in CYP2D6 is found in 9%, 17%, and 34% of the Ethiopian, Tanzanian, and Zimbabwean populations, respectively. Clearly, lumping together all of Africa obscures the differences between the populations. The label “African” or “African-American” is therefore insufficient to determine whether an individual comes from a population with a high frequency of the *17 allele. Even if an individual is known to be, for example, Ethiopian rather than Zimbabwean, the ancestry is less relevant than the true genotype, which could be easily resolved with today's technology.

They enrolled approximately one thousand people who “self-identified as black (defined as of African descent)” and hoped to demonstrate that BiDil was more effective than the placebo. In summer 2004, researchers halted the study prematurely; analysis of the initial data revealed a 43 percent decreased mortality rate among patients on BiDil compared to those on placebo.""""""Opponents of the race-specificity claim argued that such claims were empirically unfounded. After all, the NitroMed study did not enroll any other self-identified races (Dorr and Jones 2008). Hence, it actually had zero data on the effect of race specificity. Still, the power of biological determinism and racial essentialism held. After the FDA’s advisory council met in June 2005 to consider arguments for and against BiDil and its claims of race-specific metabolism, the FDA approved BiDil as a medication indicated for use specifically in self-identified blacks (cf. Gellene 2005)."""

Those who approach the matter from this angle have a very different view of how to think about diabetes prevention and treatment. In the graphic below on ‘prevalence of diabetes in related populations’ note the striking pattern of urban versus rural dwelling among six populations across the globe. Those who live in urban areas and consume a westernized diet have a very high rate of diabetes, but those who have lived in ‘traditional’ sites where they practice ‘traditional culture’ hardly experience any diabetes.

IATs were poor predictors of every criterion category other than brain activity, and the IATs performed no better than simple explicit measures.

Areas with high concentration of Mexican immigrants and import exposure to Mexico and China are actually more likely to favor Hillary another Republican candidate or Hillary Clinton.

The results show mixed evidence that economic distress has motivated Trump support. His supporters are less educated and more likely to work in blue collar occupations, but they earn relatively high household incomes and are no less likely to be unemployed or exposed to competition through trade or immigration. On the other hand, living in racially isolated communities with worse health outcomes, lower social mobility, less social capital, greater reliance on social security income and less reliance on capital income, predicts higher levels of Trump support.** We confirm the theoretical results of our regression analysis using machine learning algorithms and an extensive set of additional variables.

london: diversity actually *increases trust* and segregation decreases trust for young people (who grew up in a diverse society) but not for old people: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2013.831932> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/01419870.2013.831932> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643217745151787008/rers_a_831932_f0003_oc.png These relationships are strongly moderated by age cohort: the positive effect of diversity and the negative effect of segregation among the youngest adults both weaken over successive cohorts, until the direction of the association is reversed among the oldest residents of London's neighbourhoods. The moderating effect of age on the association between diversity and social cohesion for white residents provides further evidence in support of the idea that growing up in a multicultural society in which ethnic minorities play a visible and positive role serves to shift the attitudes and behaviours of younger ethnic majority cohorts in prosocial directions. [....] We include the following individual-level control variables that are plausibly related to both social cohesion and neighbourhood preference: age; sex; ethnic group; social class; marital status; housing tenure; and the length of time that an individual has lived in the area.
for four measures of positive neighborhood beliefs, class was significant for 4, age for 3, education for 3, racial diversity for 1: <http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9248.2007.00692.x> <https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/Politics/papers/2005/NLetki_social%20capital%20and%20diversity_final.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634182353979179008/unknown.png

# metastudies: ethnic diversity
across 87 studies, ethnic diversity negatively predicted trust, but could explain just 0.66% of variation in trust: <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-020708> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1146/annurev-polisci-052918-020708> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/767112460351176784/dineson2020.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638488088557125643/unknown.png In substantive terms, the partial correlation of -0.0256 (se = 0.0044) between ethnic diversity and trust is rather modest. Under the scenario of our back-of-the-envelope calculation (see above), it corresponds to a 0.66% increase in the aggregate between-context unit R^2 after all other variables in the model have been accounted for (see Online Supplement C).
in metastudy, about as many studies studies reject as support the "diversity causes distrust" hypothesis (support:reject ratio of 1:2 for country, 2:1 for region, 1:2 for city, 1.5:1 for neighborhood): <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043309> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/544262606438006814/unknown.png We find that (a) there is consistent support for the constrict claim for aspects of social cohesion that are spatially bounded to neighborhoods, (b) support for the constrict claim is more common in the United States than in other countries, and (c) ethnic diversity is not related to less interethnic social cohesion.

Arcidiacono Lovenheim Zhu 2015: literature review: affirmative action primarily operates by shifting which colleges minority students apply to, not whether they apply to college at all: <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115445> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115445> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1160086338373177354/arcidiacono2015.pdf> """Arcidiacono (2005) allows admissions probabilities and financial aid to vary for blacks and whites in estimation. He then uses the estimates to forecast how black decisions and outcomes would change if they faced the admissions rules that whites faced. The counterfactual simulations show that removing racial preferences reduces the earnings of black students, but the effect is very small. The reason for this is twofold: (a) Similar to the results in Section 4.2, Arcidiacono finds that affirmative action primarily affects where students go to college not whether they go at all, and (b) the estimated returns to college quality are low. Indeed, the estimated returns to being a science or business major are substantially larger than a one–standard deviation change in college quality. Arcidiacono finds a bigger effect on earnings if racial preferences in financial aid are removed, as doing so reduces black college enrollment. One caveat is that college quality is proxied for by the average math SAT score of the student body.13 To the extent that this is a noisy measure of college quality, the returns to college quality may be biased downward (for a discussion of this issue, see Black & Smith 2004, 2006)."""

# mismatch: effect on graduation rates: summary
Arcidiacono Lovenheim Zhu 2015: literature review: affirmative action bans do not appear to affect the graduation rate of minority students -- which is surprising, given that affirmative action bans force minority students toward "worse" colleges: <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115445> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115445> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1160086338373177354/arcidiacono2015.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1160086494808113284/image.png?ex=653361bd&is=6520ecbd&hm=9a9252977ccc2fc4aa80367875e6289e1fa33ce88da222f57d2bfe9bad687fe7& Affirmative Action in Undergraduate Education """That affirmative action bans do not affect minority college graduation rates even though there is a large average effect of college quality on graduation is surprising. There are two potential explanations for these seemingly conflicting sets of results, which are not mutually exclusive. First, the opposing effects of an increase in college quality and decrease in academic match quality may offset each other in the presence of affirmative action. An implication of this explanation is that moving minority students out of the lowest-ranked colleges at which college quality effects dominate (Arcidiacono & Koedel 2015) and practicing mild affirmative action at elite schools at which match effects are more important could increase overall minority graduation rates. The second explanation flows from the findings of Arcidiacono et al. (2014) that universities spend more resources on minority student postban to help them succeed. Endogenous institutional responses may lead to a smaller (or larger) effect of banning affirmative action that makes it difficult to generalize the findings from these studies to other contexts. If a school responds to a ban in affirmative action by changing the way it treats URM students relative to majority students, one can view this as another form of affirmative action. That is, the school is targeting resources toward URM students to help them succeed (e.g., through tutoring, advising), but now the focus of affirmative action efforts is on the in-college experience rather than on admissions. In such a case, it is no longer clear what outcomes can causally be attributed to affirmative action itself. Institutional responses to affirmative action bans are not well understood, and we view this as an important avenue for future research."""

We find that there is substantial excess heterogeneity in the empirical distribution of the racial gap in the incarceration rate. The quantitative impact of this gap on sentencing disparity is of considerable magnitude. If a defendant assigned to a 10th-percentile judge was instead sentenced by a 90th-percentile judge, the racial gap in the incarceration rate would rise by a full 18 percentage points.

Derenoncourt et al 2022: 1st: flow-based policies, which raise black income growth, saving, and capital gains rates, are likely to have a small effect unless they elevate black income/saving/gains over white rates; the authors estimate that even if capital gains, savings rates, and income growth were equal for white and black people, it would take until 2200 (!) for black income to equal white income -- at which point that white-black wealth ratio would still be 1.88x! <https://sites.google.com/view/ellora-derenoncourt/us-inequality-data> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/985378803427737610/ellencourt2022.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/985379537724526602/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/985379722122907648/unknown.png
Derenoncourt et al 2022: 2nd: Stock-based policies: Classic reparations. A one-time payment of $267k per person to each descendant of enslaved people would instantly reduce the white-black wealth ratio to 1.4x! But this fix would be very temporary. Black people have lower income, capital gains, and savings rates If unchanged, the wealth ratio would grow to >3x after 120y If ~halved, the ratio would grow to 2x after 240y If {capital gains and savings rates} were equal (but not income), the ratio would stabilize at ~1.1x: <https://sites.google.com/view/ellora-derenoncourt/us-inequality-data> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/985378803427737610/ellencourt2022.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/985379834643505212/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/985379955070365726/unknown.png

# failure of immediate land reform
Oubre 1976: brief summary of the failure of land reform: in March 1865, Congress instructed the Freedmen's Bureau to grant 40 acres of confiscated or abandoned land (usually from slavers) to freedmen; by April 1866, most of that land had been restored to its former owners or sold to Northern businessmen: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4231584> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/988328098980298802/unknown.png """In March 1865, Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands to assist freedmen in making the difficult transition from slavery to freedom. Congress instructed the Bureau to rent forty acres of confiscated or abandoned land to each freedman family. By April 1866, however, most of the confiscated and abandoned lands had been restored to former owners or sold to northern businessmen. Therefore, in order to make land available to the freedmen, Congress enacted the Southern Homestead Act in June 1866, restricting all remaining public lands in five southern states (approximately forty-six million acres) to entry for homestead only. To assure that freedmen and loyal whites would have first choice of the public lands the act restricted entry to these classes exclusively until January 1, 1867, and until June 1868, no entry could be made for more than forty acres of double minimum land, that is, land within six miles of a railroad or navigable stream, or eighty acres of minimum land. Moreover, the act provided that until June 1868 the homesteader would only pay a two dollar filing fee at the time of entry, and would not have to pay the five dollar registration fee until his patent was issued five years later."""
Engs 1979: Southern landowners regained almost all of the land they had claimed before the war; under pressure from Johnson and pro-capital Northern politicians, the Freedmen's Bureau was transformed from a protector of freedmen land rights to an enforcer of the plantation wage system: <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/918168073> <https://archive.org/details/ncis00robe> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/988573131453116416/engs1979.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/988332234379513866/unknown.png """Throughout the South, freedmen were required to make labor contracts with their former owners, and local Bureau agents were charged to enforce the terms of these agreements. Black refugees from rural counties were returned to their home plantations despite proof that they would be subject to mistreatment. Rather than fostering black independence, the Bureau became an agency to assist Southern whites in perpetuating black subordination. Agents who resisted these perversions of the Bureau's purpose, like Wilder, or Saxton in South Carolina, were dismissed and replaced by officers more amenable to the president and his southern allies."""

The evidence on whether trans brains align more closely with the identified-as sex or the natal sex is mixed. Most evidence suggests trans brains lean toward their identified-as sex; however, conflicting evidence might suggest that trans brains are "in the middle".

Studies of DSD patients and neuroanatomical studies provide the strongest evidence for the organic basis of transgender identity. Because the sample sizes of most studies on this subject were small, the conclusions must be interpreted with caution.

In fact, in the original papers in which Blanchard first developed and tested his theory of autogynephilia (Blanchard, 1989a, 1989b, 1991, 1992), there is no exploration or even discussion of the possibility that cross-gender arousal may be an effect of gender dysphoria (rather than its cause) or that both traits might simply correlate in nonandrophilic MtF individuals for some other reason."""
Serano 2010: many trans women report declining cross-gender arousal over time, especially after social or medical transition, suggesting against the idea that autogynephilia is a true paraphilia, that it causes transgender identity, and toward the idea that it begins as a taboo act and becomes routine: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15532739.2010.514223> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/15532739.2010.514223> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/991175921673449532/serano2010.pdf> """Second, the presumption of causality is challenged by the fact that many MtF spectrum people who experience cross-gender arousal find that it is merely a passing phase rather than central to their transgender experience. For instance, transsexual women typically experience a sharp decrease in cross-gender arousal after transition (Lawrence, 2005). While one could argue that this reduction might simply be a by-product of having lower androgen levels, some transsexuals experience this reduction in cross-gender arousal prior to hormone therapy and orchiectomy (Serano, 2007). Further, many MtF crossdressers who have not taken steps toward physical transition also experience a decrease in cross-gender arousal over time (Buhrich & Beaumont, 1981; Buhrich & McConaghy, 1977a, 1977b; Doorn, Poortinga, & Verschoor, 1994; Ovesey & Person, 1976). While early explorations of feminine clothing and thoughts of female embodiment may be highly arousing (perhaps related to the sexual symbolism associated with femaleness and femininity in our culture), this sexual charge wanes for many MtF cross-dressers and pretransition transsexuals as they begin to interact socially in the feminine role, to develop a conscious female identity, and/or to view their transgender inclinations as authentic and nothing to be ashamed of (Doorn et al., 1994; Serano, 2007)."""

Indeed, critics of autogynephilia theory have argued that such sex embodiment fantasies appear to be an obvious coping mechanism for pretransition transsexuals (e.g., Barnes, 2001; Gooren, 2006; Serano, 2007). This coping mechanism explanation would also help to account for the sharp decrease in such fantasies that occurs in transsexual women after transition (Lawrence, 2005)."""

Serano 2020: autogynephilia should be reconsidered as female/feminine embodiment fantasies (FEFs) in which one fantasizes about having the body of a female: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0038026120934690> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/0038026120934690> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/991168695080591400/serano2020.pdf> """Second, the notion that FEFs have the potential to cause transsexuality is specious and not supported by the evidence (Serano, 2010, 2020). After all, almost a third of Lehmiller’s subjects experienced crosssex/gender sexual fantasies (Lehmiller, 2018, p. 66), yet the vast majority of these people will never develop gender dysphoria or desire to transition. Furthermore, most ‘nonclassical’ trans women either never experience FEFs, or experience FEFs only after they have experienced gender dysphoria, thus ruling out the possibly that FEFs caused them to become transgender (Serano, 2010)."""

In contrast to this approach, Veale (2014) performed taxometric analyses on her subjects’ responses to questions regarding sexual orientation, FEFs, and other aspects of sexuality, and found that the results were dimensional rather than categorical (i.e. trans women fell along a spectrum rather than into distinct subtypes). In an earlier study using the same dataset, Veale et al. (2008) found that when trans women were grouped according to their experiences with FEFs, they did not differ significantly on measures of sexual orientation."""

For instance, about one-quarter of men and women had fantasized about cross-dressing, and nearly a third had fantasized about trading bodies with someone of the other sex. In addition, about one in four men and one in six women had fantasized about sex with a cross-dresser, and even more (about one in three men and one in four women) had fantasized about sex with a transsexual partner. My findings revealed that virtually all gender-bending fantasies were more common among men than women, for reasons we’ll explore in the next chapter.""" """As the latter example illustrates, there’s sometimes an element of dominance-submission and/or humiliation involved in crossdressing fantasies; however, in cases like this, it is almost exclusively men who want to be “feminized” by a dominant female partner—I didn’t read a single fantasy about a woman who wanted to be masculinized by a male partner. Thus, at least for men, fantasies about cross-dressing may sometimes be viewed as an extension of a more general interest in BDSM."""

In a similar fashion, the recognition of transracial identity might eventually involve a shift away from an emphasis on ancestral ties or skin color of origin toward an emphasis on racial self-identification. In both cases, I think we have stronger reasons to accept individuals’ self-identities than to force them to feel beholden to an identity thrust upon them at birth.10 The argument for this point is broadly Millian; as a rule, we should encourage “different experiments in living” and not interfere with others’ liberty unless doing so would prevent harm to others (Mill 2002, 47). I hope to have shown that harm to members of a race is not an inevitable or obvious consequence of transracialism and, importantly, no more inevitable or obvious in the case of race than of sex."""

During this period, 504 adolescents were seen in our gender identity service. Fiftythree participants did not complete the assessment process and did, therefore, not participate in this study. The reason for dropout was failure to complete the questionnaire or alternation of symptoms of GD. Of the adolescents diagnosed with GD, 179 were about to start GAH treatment. One participant did not complete the questionnaire and was thus excluded. Therefore, in this cross-sectional study, the three groups that were compared consisted of (1) adolescents who just started the assessment process (n ¼ 272; mean age ¼ 14.5 years; 116 assigned boys at birth and 156 assigned girls at birth), (2) adolescents diagnosed with GD who were on puberty suppression and about to start GAH treatment (n ¼ 178; mean age ¼ 16.8 years; 68 assigned boys at birth and 110 assigned girls at birth), and (3) cisgender adolescents recruited from the general population (n ¼ 651; mean age ¼ 15.4 years; 346 assigned boys at birth and 305 assigned girls at birth).

This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13 patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who regretted genital surgery. The composition of the patients who sought detransition is as follows: 16 trans-men, 37 trans-women, and 6 non-binary patients. The most common reason cited for detransition was change in gender identity (22 patients) followed by rejection or alienation from family or social support (8 patients) and difficulty in romantic relationships (7 patients). Chronic post-operative pain was also cited as a reason for detransition. 7 trans-women who sought detransition had vaginal stenosis, 2 had rectovaginal fistulae, and 3 had chronic genital pain. 2 trans-men who sought detransition had a urethral fistula and one had a urethral stricture. 9 of the 46 respondents performed a total of 38 detransition procedures.

Attention to this disparity has been limited, in part because neither the U.S. death certificate nor the NVDRS identify decedents’ sexual orientation or gender identity. Thus, it is not known whether LGBT people die by suicide at higher rates than comparable heterosexual people.

# suicide rate vs slaves
the completed suicide rate among slaves was ~.72 per 100,000 in the USA in 1850: <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1654> <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191102161632/https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> There are a few sources that provide numbers. Lester includes a table of suicide rates calculated from the 1850 census. 180 According to this, slaves in 1850 had a suicide rate of .72 per 100,000 while whites had a rate of 2.37 and freed slaves a rate of 1.15. P. D. Escott searched Federal Writer's Project Slave Narratives and documented resistance. In his list, which included a total of 413 incidents of resistance, there were seven incidents of suicide. This leaves suicide to account for 1.2% of incidents of resistance.
suicide among black people is diminished by religiosity and self-perception: <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1654> <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191102161632/https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> However, today there are some black churches which teach that suicide is an unredeemable act. This teaching appears to have developed after Reconstruction but was very likely affected by attitudes toward suicide that trace back to slavery. In the early 1990s, Kevin Early conducted a sociological survey among black churches in Gainesville, Florida, and established that black pastors tend to view suicide as an unredeemable act. “The overall condemnation of suicide as sin remains clear. Terminal or painful disease is no excuse for giving up. It merely enhances the quality of life through struggle. After all, struggling is inherently part of the black experience.” 185 Early establishes that while pastors condemn both suicide and criminal behavior, they tend to label individuals involved in typical property and violent crimes, including homicide, as victims of their environment. They argue that parents were too hard on children, society did not offer them the same benefits as white families, and they did not have good economic or educational opportunities. 186 In contrast, when they discussed suicide, it was uniformly condemned as “sinful” and the belief was proposed that “adversity can be overcome without resorting to suicide.” 187 Blacks described themselves as “able to endure more hardship without succumbing to the despair and despondency that lead to suicide.” 188 Along that same idea, “African Americans view themselves as being more religious, more spiritual than their white counterparts, and more able to endure hardship.”

quoting an anti-trans source: alleged increase in bathroom incidents may be due to media change, not policy change: <http://womanmeanssomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-Longitudinal-Analysis-of-Media-Reports-at-Target-Stores.pdf> Another potential limitation of our analysis is that we don't know if pressure on Target has impacted media reporting. It may be that in some areas, perhaps in conservative locales, a bias may exist to report more of the total Target incidents occurring. It could also be that in other areas a liberal bias would lead to the suppression of news stories. We have noted a tendency in some states, usually liberal ones, to not report addresses of the incident locations. This may or may not be related to media bias.

Same-sex marriage policies were associated with a 0.6–percentage point (95% CI, –1.2 to –0.01 percentage points) reduction in suicide attempts, representing a 7% relative reduction in the proportion of high school students attempting suicide owing to same-sex marriage implementation. The association was concentrated among students who were sexual minorities.

most abuse rate studies are terrible: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X03003458> Probably the most difficult methodological obstacle in studying same-sex intimate violence is obtaining a representative sample; even studies based on large samples typically have used nonrandom sampling methods, with respondent recruitment often occurring through gay and lesbian publications, organizations, and activities [6]. Two studies with better methodology reported prevalence estimates of 25% and 17% for ever having experienced physical victimization in a lesbian relationship 12, 13; these figures are comparable to figures for heterosexual relationships.

# causes of homosexuality
the gay gene doesn't exist: <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-017-1092-4.pdf> However, the search for genes contributing to homosexuality, which started 25 years ago, has been largely unsuccessful. Although a recentlarge genome-wide association study (GWAS) by Sanders et al. (2015) has documented two chromosomal regions associated with male homosexuality (one X-linked, the other on autosome 8), which has resolved some conflicting results obtained from earlier attempts (Bailey et al.,1999; Hamer etal.,1993;Huetal.,1995;Mustanskietal.,2005;Ramagopalan, Dyment, Handunneththi, Rice, & Ebers, 2010; Rice, Anderson, Risch, & Ebers, 1999), both these regions have a small effect sizes and low power in predicting homosexual versus heterosexual orientation. Collectively, GWAS thus indicate that there are nomajor genes contributing to male homosexuality. No comparable studies on female homosexuality exist.

# Invisible Victims: Delayed Onset Depression among Adults with Same-Sex Parents
sullins' study: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4903140/>
sullins counted any child who ever lived in a household headed by a gay person as a child growing up in a same-sex household -- including single or divorced parents: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204108/> Sullins achieves this through a crucial elision between households in which a child spent some time in a home headed by a same-sex couple and families in which a child was actually raised, from birth, by a stable same-sex couple, a situation more auspicious for healthy child development. This conflation of household stability with parent gender fatally mars his conclusions, which are much more damning of gay and lesbian parenting than are warranted by his data. [....] This descriptor, of course, is the key variable in the discourse on optimal child-rearing because of the well-established fact that children who experience divorce or other family disruptions are at higher risk for a number of disadvantages, including the ones that Sullins inaccurately associates with “same-sex parented” households. What Sullins has done makes no more sense than surveying a hospital to derive mortality rates. It is hard to imagine that Sullins does not know this and equally hard to watch his misleading findings get past peer review.

# gay parenting
the American Psychological Association believes sexuality is not a significant predictor of parenting outcomes: <http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/gay-parents-as-good-as-straight-ones/> <http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377.full.pdf> On the basis of this comprehensive review of the literature regarding the development and adjustment of children whose parents are the same gender, as well as the existing evidence for the legal, social, and health benefits of marriage to children, the AAP concludes that it is in the best interests of children that they be able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing and care that comes with the civil marriage of their parents, without regard to their parents’ gender or sexual orientation.
75 studies demonstrate that same-sex couples and different-sex couples produce roughly equivalent children: <https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/> A 2010 study by Stanford researcher Michael Rosenfeld used census data to examine the school advancement of 3,500 children with same-sex parents, finding no significant differences between households headed by same-sex and opposite-sex parents when controlling for family background. Another study drew on nationally representative, longitudinal data using a sampling pool of over 20,000 children, of which 158 lived in a same-sex parent household. Controlling for family disruptions, those children showed no significant differences from their peers in school outcomes.
in meta-analysis, two dads vs two moms was insignificant: <https://thewinnower.com/papers/3532-knowing-what-we-don-t-know-a-meta-analysis-of-children-raised-by-gay-or-lesbian-parents> A third potential explanation, based on theories of gender development (Leaper & Friedman, 2007; McHale, Crouter, & Whiteman, 2003), has to do with the presence of a parent of the same or opposite gender as the child. There was, however, no support for this explanation. Children raised by gay fathers were no different than children raised by lesbian mothers, and the differences associated with parent sexual orientation did not vary between boys and girls.
in meta-analysis, same-sex parents appear to do worse on some indicators (internalizing, externalizing, social competence, academic competence) and better on others (positive relationships, parental warmth), but the data is usually of such poor quality that no reliable conclusions can be drawn (the moderator effects have larger size than the effect size): <https://thewinnower.com/papers/3532-knowing-what-we-don-t-know-a-meta-analysis-of-children-raised-by-gay-or-lesbian-parents> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/587971826961874951/unknown.png

The proposal would allow the presumed father, the biological father or the mother to challenge the paternity until a child turns 2. The proposal had two goals: to balance the rights of children with those of their presumed fathers and to encourage parentage questions to be raised early in a child’s life, before deep bonds are formed. Several states, including Delaware, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, have adopted that model or a variation of it.

review of HIV and circumcision: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127372/> He made no mention of male circumcision, yet there is now compelling epidemiological evidence from over 40 studies which shows that male circumcision provides significant protection against HIV infection; circumcised males are two to eight times less likely to become infected with HIV.2 Furthermore, circumcision also protects against other sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea,3,4 and since people who have a sexually transmitted infection are two to five times more likely to become infected with HIV,5 circumcision may be even more protective. No new infections occurred among any of the 50 circumcised men over 30 months, whereas 40 of 137 uncircumcised men became infected during this time. Both groups had been given free access to HIV testing, intensive instruction about preventing infection, and free condoms (which were continuously available), but 89% of the men never used condoms, and condom use did not seem to influence the rate of transmission of HIV.

Men’s wish to dominate or control women was later proposed to motivate sexual harassment. Research now considers a more basic motive: The desire to retain a valued social identity and attendant benefits in a system of gender hierarchy. Given that this theorizing has continued for several decades, it is striking to see how little empirical research has focused explicitly on harassers (exceptions include Bargh et al., 1995; Dekker and Barling, 1998; Perry et al., 1998; Pryor, 1987; Pryor et al., 1993). This is an important direction for future studies."""

Whereas the first two categories suggest sexual advances (the goal being sexual exploitation of women), the third category is expressing hostility toward women (the goals being insult, humiliation, or ostracism) (Holland and Cortina 2016). In other words, sexual coercion and unwanted sexual attention can be viewed as “come-ons,” while gender harassment is, for all intents and purposes, a “put-down” (Fitzgerald, Gelfand, and Drasgow 1995; Leskinen, Cortina, and Kabat 2011). However, it is important to note that these come-on behaviors are not necessarily about attraction to women; more often than not, they are instead motivated by the desire to devalue women or punish those who violate gender norms (Berdahl 2007b; Cortina and Berdahl 2008)."""

The biological model holds that SH is not actually harassment and, consequently, does not have deleterious consequences, is not sexist and is not discriminatory (Tangri et al. 1982). Unsurprisingly, this explanation has been largely dismissed in the recent literature, not least because of the lack of rigour in allowing for differential predictions of behaviour and a lack of flexibility to explain phenomena such as same-sex harassment and harassment of lower status men by women in positions of power (Foote and Goodman-Delahunty 2005)."""

Although variously interpreted, in general, power perspectives suggest that the SH phenomenon arises from men’s economic power over women, which enables them to exploit and coerce women sexually (MacKinnon 1979; Zalk 1990). In early work, Brant and Too (1994) argued that the power model of SH ignored extensive evidence suggesting that harassment from peers or juniors can be more common than harassment by those in authority. However, reconciling the power model of SH with studies identifying that co-workers are frequently harassers, Samuels (2003) suggests that power from a feminist perspective is not a pure or unmediated force, but that ‘in society, the balance of power lies with men and even if women are in more senior positions they are made more vulnerable by the fact they are women’ (p. 477). Another way in which power can be conceived is within a dependency framework, where clients or customers have power vis-à-vis an employee through control over evaluations and through the dependence on the client’s business (Gettman and Gelfand 2007; Pfeffer and Salancik 2003). Recently, Popovich and Warren (2010), building on French and Raven’s (1959) typology of the bases of power (e.g. legitimate, coercive, referent), proposed a promising model of the role of power across individual, organizational and societal levels."""

Hierarchical work environments like the military, where there is a large power differential between organizational levels and an expectation is not to question those higher up, tend to have higher rates of sexual harassment than organizations that have less power differential between the organizational levels, like the private sector and government (Ilies et al. 2003; Schneider, Pryor, and Fitzgerald 2011). Environments that allow drinking during work breaks and have permissive norms related to drinking are positively associated with higher levels of gender harassment of women (Bacharach, Bamberger, and McKinney 2007). Culturally, these are, again, patterns more common in currently or historically male-dominated workplaces."""

The unadjusted figures suggest that women in supportive states paid more for a first-trimester surgical procedure than women in hostile states. However, the pattern was reversed when the cost of living adjustment was applied: women paid $40 more in hostile ($442) than in supportive ($402) states. Women in middle-ground states paid the most, regardless of which figure was used. Women paid an average of $535 for an EMA in 2014, $27 more than a first-trimester surgical procedure. According to figures adjusted for cost of living, this procedure cost most in hostile states ($479) and least in supportive ones ($419). On average, women paid $27 more for medication abortion at EMA-only facilities than at facilities that also offered surgical abortion. This pattern was consistent across the three policy climates, ranging from $9 more in hostile states to $35 more in supportive ones (according to the adjusted figures). Abortions at later gestational lengths require greater technical skills and resources, and, in turn, cost more (Hammond & Chasen, 2009, p. 11). In 2014, the median charge for an abortion at 20 weeks gestation was $1,195 (data not shown). Clinics in hostile states charged the most, at $1,350 (adjusted for cost of living), and clinics in supportive states charged the least, at $964; clinics in middle-ground states charged slightly less than hostile states at $1,158."""

[Not less than 1/4 but not more than 1/3 of adult Polish women have interrupted their pregnancy during their life, with high probability. On the scale of the whole society this gives between 4.1 and 5.8 million women.] <http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/uslifetimeab.html> Summary: It is estimated here that, as of 2008, about 28% of U.S. women ages 15-64 have had abortions. This figure has risen from 2.8% in 1973 to 11% in 1980, 19% in 1987, 24% in 1994, and 27% in 2001. In 2008, of women ages 40-55, about 40% have had abortions in their lifetimes.

According to her, 10-15% of these abortions are induced abroad. (Dubrowska 2010.) This estimation would mean that up to 30 000 Polish women travel each year abroad to seek abortion. According to the latest estimations of the Federation for Women and Family Planning (2016), over 100 000 abortions are induced every year in Poland, meaning that every fourth Polish woman has experienced an abortion.

Similarly, girls might have scored higher than boys in science, but they were often even better in reading. Critically, the magnitude of these sex differences in personal academic strengths and weaknesses was strongly related to national gender equality, with larger differences in more gender-equal nations. These intraindividual differences in turn may contribute, for instance, to parental beliefs that boys are better at science and mathematics than girls (Eccles & Jacobs, 1986; Gunderson, Ramirez, Levine, & Beilock, 2012). We also found that boys often expressed higher selfefficacy, more joy in science, and a broader interest in science than did girls. These differences were also larger in more gender-equal countries and were related to the students’ personal academic strength.

Eastern Bloc countries once celebrated the equality of men and women as one of the unique products of building a socialist society, in no small part because socialist countries faced severe labor shortages after WWI in the USSR and after WWII throughout the Soviet Bloc. As a result, socialist countries began training women in science and engineering well before Western countries. For instance, 43% of Romanian students enrolled in engineering institutes were women in 1970, as were 39% of all engineering students in the USSR and 27% of students in Bulgaria.

data from Swedish male-female twins suggests that male and female distributions of personality on the Big Five are ~1 standard deviation apart and that genetics explains ~1/3 of these differences; prenatal hormones also probably affect these differences: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/individual-differences-in-personality-masculinityfemininity-examining-the-effects-of-genes-environment-and-prenatal-hormone-transfer/C5C72DBFD24FA1E7D9B460B9047F43FC/core-reader> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1017/thg.2016.8> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618488340806631434/unknown.png """On average, males scored 1.09 standard deviations higher on the discriminant score than females, indicating a large effect size (males Mean = 0.64 [SD = 1.01], females Mean=-0.45 [SD = 0.99]).

Females with CAH scored in between males and typical females on the Things-People dimension; their intermediate score might reflect a dose effect of prenatal androgen or the feminizing effects of socialization or other biological factors related to XX karyotype."""

# social conditioning
performing gender may cause hormone differences (rather than the reverse): <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653185/> Using a novel experimental design, participants (trained actors) performed a specific type of competition (wielding power) in stereotypically masculine vs. feminine ways. We hypothesized in H1 (stereotyped behavior) that wielding power increases testosterone regardless of how it is performed, vs. H2 (stereotyped performance), that wielding power performed in masculine but not feminine ways increases testosterone. We found that wielding power increased testosterone in women compared with a control, regardless of whether it was performed in gender-stereotyped masculine or feminine ways. Results supported H1 over H2: stereotyped behavior but not performance modulated testosterone. These results also supported theory that competition modulates testosterone over masculinity. Our findings thus support a gender→testosterone pathway mediated by competitive behavior. Accordingly, cultural pushes for men to wield power and women to avoid doing so may partially explain, in addition to heritable factors, why testosterone levels tend to be higher in men than in women: A lifetime of gender socialization could contribute to “sex differences” in testosterone. Our experiment opens up new questions of gender→testosterone pathways, highlighting the potential of examining nature/nurture interactions and effects of socialization on human biology.

# single parenthood / single motherhood

# divorce necessary: conflict bad
high-conflict married families were just as likely to have negative outcomes as were single mothers: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.03.002> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636527287981965362/unknown.png Despite caveats concerning potential underestimates of conflict, we find that children from high conflict married-parent families do more poorly in the domains of schooling and substance use, and are at greater risk of early family formation and dissolution, relative to children from low conflict married-parent families. In half of our outcomes, high conflict, stepfather, and single-mother families are statistically indistinguishable in their associations with young adult well-being. [....] Compared to those from low conflict married-parent families, the risks of each of our family-related transitions are anywhere from 25% to upwards of 100% greater for children from high conflict married-parent, stepfather, and single-mother families (not statistically significant in the case of high conflict married-parent families and early cohabitation). Risks also tend to be greater for children from stepfather and single-mother families, relative to children from high conflict married-parent families, although differences are not consistently statistically significant (see “key contrasts”).
mothers who are single by choice (rather than separation, divorce, death, etc.) had insignificantly different parenting outcomes from married mothers, except that single mothers had less-frequent "battles" with children: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886836/> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1037/fam0000188> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636529228954861588/unknown.png There were no differences in parenting quality between family types apart from lower mother–child conflict in solo mother families. Neither were there differences in child adjustment. Perceived financial difficulties, child’s gender, and parenting stress were associated with children’s adjustment problems in both family types. The findings suggest that solo motherhood, in itself, does not result in psychological problems for children.

# weak effect: crime
Barber 2004: the rate of single motherhood *today* has a large, significant positive correlation with crime -- but single motherhood *18 years ago* had a small, significant negative correlation with crime: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1069397104267479> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1177/1069397104267479> """Regression analyses that controlled for masculinity of the population (sex ratio of 15- to 64-year-olds) and national wealth (log gross national product, GNP, per capita) found that current single parenthood ratios were strongly and consistently predictive of violent crimes, whereas single parenthood ratios 18 years ago were not. [....] Even more remarkable were the regression results, in which a large positive effect of 1991 illegitimacy ratios on all violent-crime measures was produced. None of the regressions produced a positive relationship between 1972 illegitimacy ratios and crime, providing a remarkably clear rejection of the parental investment hypothesis in favor of the mating competition prediction."""

# weak effect: variety
single parenthood explained just 1% of the variation of adult outcomes: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/482426> In agreement with much previous research into the effects of single parenthood on children, increasing exposure to a single-parent family in childhood was associated with increasing risks of later anxiety, poorer educational and economic outcomes, and criminal offending. However, these associations were rather weak, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.01 to 0.22 (median, 0.10). These results imply that, typically, variation in exposure to single parenthood accounted for about 1% of the variation in outcomes in adulthood. These statistics reflected the facts that (1) most of those exposed to single parenthood did not develop later difficulties and (2) many of those developing later difficulties were not exposed to single parenthood.
anxiety disorder rates, university degree rates, welfare dependence, income, arrest or conviction rates, and property or violence offences were insignificantly correlated with single motherhood: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/482426> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640935399824556045/yoa70019t2.png Table 2 shows that, when due allowance was made for social and contextual factors associated with single parenthood, the duration of exposure to single parenthood during childhood was largely unrelated to later outcomes. There were only 2 possible exceptions to this trend; after adjustment, significant associations (P < .05) remained between exposure to single parenthood and later anxiety disorder and welfare dependence. At the same time, given the many comparisons made in Table 2, these associations could be due to chance variation as a result of multiple tests of significance. To address this issue, a Bonferroni-adjusted38P value (P < .007) was used to correct for multiple (n = 7) tests of significance. In this instance, the adjusted associations between exposure to single parenthood and later anxiety disorder and between single parenthood and welfare dependence were not statistically significant (P > .007) using the Bonferroni correction.

After 1989, the positive effect of peacekeeping on peace is much stronger (Table 7). Ceteris paribus, when the international community deploys peacekeepers the risk of another round of fighting drops by almost 70% (from 1.00 to 0.32). It is statistically unlikely (less than 5% chance) that we would see such a large effect if no true relationship between peacekeeping and peace existed. The size of the effect is a bit smaller for UN peacekeeping, which reduces the hazard of war by about half. Non-UN missions appear to have a larger effect (smaller hazard ratio) than UN missions, but because of the smaller number of such missions, our estimates are less precise."""

Soon after the results of the voting are confirmed (by opening the ballot boxes and counting the ballots), the elected deputies to the Supreme People’s Assembly are announced by the Central Election Committee, those to the provincial (municipal) people’s assemblies by relevant provincial (municipal) election committees and those to the city (district) and county people’s assemblies by the relevant city (district) and county election committees. Currently in the DPRK, 100 % of the voters cast their ballots for the nominated candidates for deputies to the people’s assemblies. This has long been quite usual in the DPRK. The main reason behind the unanimous support for the candidates is that the voters themselves have nominated as candidates the working people including workers, farmers and intellectuals who have worked with devotion for the independent rights and interests of the voters."""

Furthermore, the composition of Parliament could be documented according to the main organizational affiliation of the candidates.

# ten principles: authoritarian
#####o
# summary
The most important document in North Korea is the Ten Principles, which citizens have to learn and possibly memorize, and which is de facto superior even to the Constitution. The document outlines the expectations that citizens have absoute loyalty to the Kim family and Juche or Kim-Il-sung-Kim-Jong-ilist ideology.

# history
the document went through two versions: the 1974 version "Ten Principles for Establishing the Party's Single-Ideology System" [당의 유일적령도체계 확립의 10대 원칙] was announced by Kim Il-sung in 1967 and published by Kim Jong-il in 1974 before consolidating power in 1980; the 2013 version "Ten Principles for Establishing the Party's Single-Leadership System" [당의 유일적령도체계확 립의 10대 원칙] was announced <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Principles_for_the_Establishment_of_a_Monolithic_Ideological_System>
in 1967, Kim Il-Sung purged the Kapsang Faction (which wanted economic reforms, to reduce the personality cult, and appoint one of its own as Kim's successor) and established the Ten Principles to cement his leaderist role: <https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/the-1967-purge-the-gapsan-faction-and-establishment-the-monolithic-ideological-system> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapsan_Faction_Incident>

Lim 2018: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/Leader_Symbols_and_Personality_Cult_in_N/pcwqBwAAQBAJ> """Symbolically speaking, it is apt to describe North Korea as a "leader state." By regulating North Koreans through the use of the Ten Principles, and monopolizing their socialization possibilities through creating an isolated social setting, the North Korean state can guarantee the stable functioning of its cult system."""
Green 2012: the Ten Principles seems to supercede the constitution, according to emigrants: <https://sinonk.com/2012/06/05/chris-green-on-10-principles/> <https://archive.ph/Q9zxq> """Regardless, as a result of this shortsightedness there are many North Korea experts and students who have seemingly now forgotten that looking at North Korea only through the materials officially disseminated by the North Korean authorities will not provide all, or indeed most, of the answers. This includes the Socialist ‘Constitution’ of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, for the country only has one constitution, and it is the Ten Principles."""
Daily NK 2013: <https://www.dailynk.com/english/what-are-the-ten-principles/> """The ten main principles and 65 sub-clauses of the Ten Principles describe in detail how to go about establishing the one-ideology system. All North Koreans have to memorize them. Not only that, they have to put them into practice; during regular evaluation meetings, people criticize themselves on the basis of whether or not they have been living up to the Ten Principles in their everyday lives."""

It was secretly carried out of the country by a collaborator inside North Korea."""

Paektu Mountain [백두산, also Baekdu Mountain or Changbai Mountain] is the tallest mountain in Korea and is mythologically the birthplace of Dangun Wanggeom, the founder of the first Korean Kingdom; the Kim family highlights the mountain in their propaganda and refers to themselves as the Paektu bloodline: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paektu_Mountain> <http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081301558.html> <https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20130812004400315> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/868653110028009532/255px-Emblem_of_North_Korea.png

"""Kim Jong-un had to inherit the lineage and ideas of his grandfather and father, and to present his own ruling ideology for the construction of a new society.

The second paragraph also stipulates that the blood of our party and the revolution-the Paektu Mountain bloodline should be continued forever... and its absolute purity should be resolutely maintained. In the previous "Ten Principles," Article 10, paragraph 1, stated that the only leadership system of the Party Central Committee should be established under the leadership of leader Kim Il Sung. A researcher at a South Korean National Policy Research Institute said, North Korea emphasized The Baektu Mountain descent, and clearly stipulated hereditary system, strengthened the idolization of the three generations of Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un's "Kim family", which is tantamount to recognizing that North Korea is a modern feudal country. The revised "Ten Principles" also include, "Make the Sun Palace of Jinxiu Mountain (the place where the remains of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il) an eternal sacred place, and vowed to defend to the death (Article 2)" and "Treat it solemnly. Works and slogans with portraits, statues, and videos of the great Baektu Mountain, and resolutely protect (Article 3)" and other content. The Kim Jong-un family is called "the great men of Mount Paektu". Article 4 also stipulates that the instructions of the leader (Kim Il Sung), the quotations of the general (Kim Jong Il), and the line and policies of the Party (Kim Jong Un regime) shall be regarded as the principles and creeds of career and life, and shall be regarded as the measure of everything According to those requirements, think and act in accordance with those requirements anytime and anywhere."""

Those responsible for this commotion are spreading confounding rumors like South Korea is a “multiracial area” mixed with the blood of Americans and several other races, how we must “overcome closed ethnic nationalism,” and we must embrace “the inclusiveness and openness of a multiethnic nation” like the United States. The words themselves take a knife to the feeling of our people, but even more serious is that this anti-national theory of “multiethnic, multiracial society” has already gone beyond the stage of discussion. Already, they’ve decided that from 2009, content related to “multiracial, multiethnic culture” would be included in elementary, middle and high school textbooks that have until now stressed that Koreans are the “descendents of Dangun,” “of one blood line” and “one race,” and to change the terms “families of international marriage” and “families of foreign laborers” to “multicultural families.” This is an outrage that makes it impossible to repress the rage of the people/race."""

# history
after the war, North Korea developed rapidly and was more industrialized than the South until the 1970's; just as quickly, it afterward stagnated and saw flat or declining standards of living: <https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/the-1967-purge-the-gapsan-faction-and-establishment-the-monolithic-ideological-system>
North Korea: """North Korea released relatively detailed statistics in the 1950s, but stopped publishing official data from the 1960s. Japanese scholars, Goto and Niwa, tried to estimate North Korea’s GDP using a method similar to the NMP-based method applied by the CIA to estimate the Soviet’s GDP (Goto, 1990; Niwa and Goto, 1989). However, while this worked until 1960, the lack of data made this endeavor no longer feasible. In addition, because there was significantly less data for North Korea than the Soviet Union, various assumptions had been made in the estimation of GDP, making the accuracy of the estimates somewhat suspect."""

# lack of gdp data: no publication

Kim 2021: growth in budget data is nominal and includes loans, and is also not listed by specific budget items, which makes using it as an estimate for real growth difficult: <https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/234189> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879877812801134622/kim2021.pdf> """Recent discussions on the North Korean growth rate also show potential for such errors. In a recent paper, the author assessed the economic conditions of North Korea to be reasonable after believing that the 4.2% growth in the 2020 budget plan released in April was the economic growth rate. But, as I pointed out earlier, the budget and settlement of accounts is a nominal variable, and in the Soviet’s case, it included its central bank loans in the budget income. There is no guarantee that North Korea is any different. And, unless specific items of the budget account are clearly stated, doubt will only escalate."""
Frank 2012: the official North Korean budget size (the only other official measure published) implies smoothly and consistently upward economic growth since 1999, which is implausible: <https://www.38north.org/2012/07/rfrank071612/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879828125108813885/unknown.png
Frank 2012: but year-to-year changes in the official North Korean budget size correlate reasonably well with changes in the growth rates estimated by the Bank of South Korea: <https://www.38north.org/2012/07/rfrank071612/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/879828133971394600/unknown.png Graph 2 also includes the North Korean GDP growth estimates by the Bank of Korea (purple line). In absolute terms, these are much lower than the North Korean data. But remarkably, the correlation coefficient for this South Korean estimate and North Korea’s officially announced achieved revenue (blue line) from 2005 to 2011 is relatively high with r=0.65 .... In other words, although both sides seem to differ about the amount of growth, at least there is some moderately strong agreement about its general direction.

The average annual growth rates of GNP are fairly comparable to those of the Soviet economy from 1928 to 1985 according to Western estimates but the rates per capita are well below those of most socialist economies in the same period (Ofer, 1987). [....] Our findings indicate that the main cause of slow or negative economic growth was extremely low total factor productivity, and that the productivity of the North Korean economy had been lower than that of the Soviet economy by 33%."""

# reforms over time
Frank 2017: the proportion of the economy that is not centrally planned is increasing: <https://www.38north.org/2017/04/rfrank042817/> The share of budget revenue coming from “local areas” is planned to reach 26.7 percent in 2017, compared to 23.2 percent in 2016 and a mere 16.1 percent in 2011. This implies that the part of the economy that is not centrally controlled is still growing, an impression I can confirm based on what I saw during my recent visits to North Korea. The Minister of Finance who delivered the report actually said that “Provinces, cities and counties envisage ensuring expenditures with their own local revenues and adding their profits to the state budget.” In other words, their income has reached a stage where they become mainly self-sufficient.

First among these was its own experience as an aid recipient and host to foreign investment. After China opened to the outside world and began to receive aid and investment from the West, and particularly from Japan, Chinese policymakers learned a new model of how aid could also serve China’s own development goals. The second influence was a pattern of state-sponsored engagement **more characteristic of the East Asian developmental state than of a communist dictatorship.**"""

Data reported by debtor countries to the World Bank suggest that most Chinese loans are concessional, but with terms that may not be the most favorable for LIDCs.1 Most Chinese loans to LIDCs have fixed interest rates with a median rate of 2 percent, a grace period of 6 years, and a maturity of 20 years. Terms to LIDCs have been stable over time, corresponding to a median grant element of 40 percent. The median annual maturity of loans to EMEs fluctuates between 12 and 18 years, and the grace period between 3 and 5 years. A growing share of loans to EMEs have flexible interest rates, benchmarked to the 6-month LIBOR rate. Interest rates that Chinese lenders apply to LIDCs are on average more favorable than loans to EMEs but remain higher than those available from other creditors for countries at low and moderate risk of debt distress. The median loan from China fully disburses between 2.5 and 7.5 years from the year of commitment, in both LIDCs and EMEs.

# resource-backing: not that abusive, based in china's history
much of Chinese international lending is backed by resource exports: <http://www.sais-cari.org/publications-working-papers> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792571707474968606/brautigam2016.pdf> """Our database identifies at least US$28.8 billion, one-third of the total loan finance, as secured by export commodities."""
one cause for this: no conversion to dollars necessary: <http://www.sais-cari.org/publications-working-papers> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792571707474968606/brautigam2016.pdf> """We see evidence of a parallel practice [to Japan financing developing in China in return for exports of coal and crude oil] in China’s zero-interest foreign aid loans to Africa in past decades: the Chinese commonly allowed borrowing governments to repay these RMB loans in export commodities.35 This barter-like arrangement freed both China and the host government from the higher transaction costs of having to do multiple conversions into dollars."""
another cause for this: increased security of the investment (for the Chinese lender): <http://www.sais-cari.org/publications-working-papers> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/792571707474968606/brautigam2016.pdf> """The point of securities like these is not for the lender (or a Chinese company) to acquire ownership of an oil well, cocoa farm, railway system, or electrical grid, but to reduce the lender’s risks in a country without a good credit rating, or where projects lack sovereign guarantees (or where sovereign guarantees are not very meaningful). For example, Angola is the largest borrower of Chinese oil-secured loans, and China imports 49 percent of Angola’s oil, partly in repayment for those loans. Yet Chinese oil companies own only a little more than 10 percent of the oil being produced in Angola; Western companies like ExxonMobil and Total dominate Angolan oil investments dating back decades.39 An escrow account filled by commodity exports or an off-take of electricity sales increases security and lowers risk. This allows projects to be financed at a reasonable interest rate."""

According to this source, the 27 counties in Khotän, Kashgar and Aqsu Prefectures, with a combined Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz population share of 90.2%, had 693,273 detainees in mid-February 2018. This would represent 12.3% of their Muslim population aged 20–79 (of 4.45 million).4 An RFA report cites the head of security in a township in Kashgar City as estimating the total number of detainees in Kashgar City at about 32,000, which would be 10.4% of its Uyghur and Kazakh population aged 20–79 (RFA 2018b). Another report cites local officials in Ghulja County as saying that their officially mandated adult internment rate was 10% (RFA 2018c). The leaked document put the total number of detainees in 68 Xinjiang counties, excluding regional and prefecture-level cities as well as the administrative units of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, at about 892,000 in spring 2018 (Mizutani 2018). Assuming a Muslim adult internment rate of 10% for cities with a majority-Muslim population and of 5% for cities where the Muslim population is less than 50%, Xinjiang’s total reeducation internment figure may be estimated at just over one million (approx. 1,060,000)."""

For example, the 2019 White Paper on “Vocational Education and Training in Xinjiang” states that “many of the trainees who have completed their studies in education and training centers have gone on to find employment in factories or enterprises”. Official statements refer to a “seamless connection” between the VETCs and employment.274 It also appears that companies in XUAR have been incentivised to hire ethnic minorities, 275 including former vocational education “trainees”. For example, an official “notice” from the Kashgar Public Information Office in 2018 stated that it had plans to transfer 100,000 individuals from vocational training to employment, while offering substantial subsidies to enterprises willing to hire “students”.276 The Government states that such employment is based on voluntary labour contracts in accordance with the law. However, the close link between the labour schemes and the counter-“extremism” framework, including the VETC system, raises concerns in terms of the extent to which such programmes can be considered fully voluntary in such contexts. As explained above, the VETC system amounts to large-scale arbitrary deprivation of liberty through involuntary placements in residential facilities and compulsory “training”,. Individuals in the system are, as a result, under a constant “menace of penalty”. For example, detainees in the VETC facilities told OHCHR they had to work within the VETC facilities as part of the “graduation process”, with no possibility of refusal for fear of being kept longer at the facilities.277"""

# boarding schools
Diamond Packer 2021: need to verify these claims todo: <https://uyghurtribunal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Diamond-Packer.pdf> """State-run, highly securitized, boarding schools and orphanages to confine Uyghur 103 children full-time, including infants. According to a Ministry of Education planning document, 104 the residential-school expansion was at the top of its list of priorities and, between 2017 and 2019, the number of children separated from their families and placed into state-run boarding schools in the region increased by 76.9%, from 497,800 to 880,500. The explicit goals of these 105 boarding schools are “to promote the teaching of the national standard language [Mandarin Chinese]... block the influence of the family's atmosphere on the children to the greatest extent and reduce the occurrence of ... listening to the scriptures at home.” The government set a 106 2020 goal of running one to two such boarding schools in each of Xinjiang’s over 800 townships. Under State custody, Uyghur children are being raised in Chinese-language 107 environments with standard Han child-rearing methods adopted by the State. The State is thus 108 forcibly transferring Uyghur children to State-run Han group settings. Expert witness Rian Thum has demonstrated that it is reasonable to conclude that the majority of Uyghur middle school students are now in residential schools and that the transfer of Uyghur children into Handominated facilities is not only a by-product of losing parents to mass internment but is an independent goal in and of itself. The systematic forcible separation of Uyghur children from 109 their families, combined with the widespread forcible prevention of Uyghur births and mass internment, threatens “the group’s capacity to renew itself, and hence to ensure its long-term survival” or existence (to use the language of the ICJ interpreting the Genocide Convention).110"""

# mobility
the societies of the USSR and Eastern Bloc had higher mobility before the transition from the communist era to the capitalist era: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562416302104> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.rssm.2017.10.004> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564802213826789406/unknown.png The hypothesis regarding the effect of the transition on intergenerational inequality in educational attainment is tested by introducing a dummy variable for the transitional cohort, and its interaction terms with parental education and occupational social class. With this regression specification in Model 4, Table 2, coefficients for social origins refer to the communist period. The characteristics of Model 3, particularly in terms of parental education, are largely maintained for individuals born between 1958 and 1972, which suggests that **there have not been radical changes in intergenerational social mobility patterns in post-communist societies**. Still, the coefficients for social origins and their interactions with the transitional cohort indicate that intergenerational inequality in educational attainment has been affected in the following ways: the interaction term between primary education and transitional cohort is statistically significant and has negative sign, which suggests that **the disadvantage associated with low parental education intensified in post-communist societies**. Nonetheless, the tertiary education-transitional cohort interaction coefficient indicates that **the advantage of having parents with a high level of education was simultaneously reduced**. Related trends are observed in relation to parental social class. In this case, the positive effect of salariat origin on individuals’ educational attainment declined, but the negative effect of working class origin intensified. In other words, **the gap between individuals from working and intermediate class origin widened during the transition**. This is in line with existing evidence that indicates that the workers were in privileged conditions in the communist era but that their situation deteriorated thereafter (Eyal and Townsley, 1995, Szelenyi, 2002).

# bad investment decisions
Allen 2001: Allen rejects the Weitzman-Easterly-Fisher hypothesis that TFP growth did not slow in the Soviet union and returns to capital slowed from insufficient labor: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858784395535319040/allen2001.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641076509414522911/unknown.png """Productivity in these arguments was calculated with a standard Cobb-Douglas framework with constant factor shares like those in the West. Weitzman 1970 challenged this interpretation by estimating a production function for the USSR. He concluded that the Cobb-Douglas specification was incorrect, and that the Soviet experience was better represented by a CES function with an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour of .4. In this framework, the growth deceleration is due to diminishing returns to capital; there is not evidence of a fall in TFP growth. The growth slowdown, in other words, does not indicate poor institutional performance. Easterley and Fisher have redone the econometrics with more recent data and confirmed the elasticity of substitution. They have been reluctant, however, to exonerate Soviet institutions.""""""One indicator of the change is unfilled vacancies on the first shift, which rose from 1 per cent in 1960, to 4.9 per cent in 1970, to 7.3 per cent in 1975, then to 9.9 per cent in 1980, and finally hit 12.2 per cent in 1985 Rumer 1989, 199–200. In the 1970s a Gosplan research director reported that 10–12 per cent of the increment in real fixed capital was unutilized, owing to a shortage of labour Rumer 1989, 202. and that proportion could only have increased in the 1980s. The capital stock rose without a corresponding rise in GDP because there was no labour to operate the new capacity."""
Allen 2001: Allen's preferred hypothesis is that TFP growth did slow because the USSR's capital investment decisions were terrible: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858784395535319040/allen2001.pdf> """Weitzman’s econometrics imply a value of 0.403 – a figure confirmed by Easterly and Fischer ~1995, 357! for the whole economy. But 0.4 is an unusually low value. Evidence for Japan and other advanced capitalist economies suggests a value of 1.0 or even greater ~Easterly and Fischer 1995, 359–61; Duffy and Papageorgiou 2000!. While simulations using an elasticity of substitution of 0.403 imply a growth slowdown, simulations with a value of 1.0 do not. With more substitutability between capital and labour, diminishing returns to capital are not substantial enough to cause stagnation, and this is why a high investment rate paid off in Japan but not in the USSR.""""""Weitzman and Easterly and Fischer speculate on reasons why the elasticity of substitution might have been lower in the USSR than elsewhere, without coming to firm conclusions. This is good; for, I will argue, the value of 0.4 is an illusion. The low measured value of the elasticity reflects massive errors in Soviet investment strategy rather than a real difference in technology. It was not purely happenstance that these errors occurred in the 1970s and 1980s; for the end of the surplus labour economy posed new management problems, and the party leadership bungled them."""

# failure of planning
the USSR's non-mathematical, "command economy" planning was unable to handle increasingly complex production chains: <https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/sovietplanningltc_seongjin_urpe20180928.pdf> Stalinist planners tried to resolve the problem of complexity inherent in a planned economy by concentrating on a limited number of sectors. Indeed, Gosplan planned only a few strategic industries, targeting the ministries and not individual companies. [....] In 1951, Gosplan’s Five-Year Plan was compiled for 127 products, while material balances, the main tool of planning, were prepared for 60 products, although there were millions of products in contemporary Russia (Gregory, 2004: 117, 152). [....] Accurate techniques like input-output tables or optimal linear programming, which could balance supply and demand, were never applied to Stalinist planning. Gosplan planned to produce goods or services on an aggregated, rather than disaggregated basis, so balancing the national economy through consistent planning was impossible from the start. In fact, Stalinist planning was not meant to achieve a balanced national economy: unbalanced growth was not a problem to be avoided but tolerated and even promoted.
the USSR's incentives system encouraged playing it safe, not playing it well: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> From the point of view of suppliers, the willingness of Soviet managers to pursue costs savings through asset replacement is deterred by what a leading Soviet investment expert terms "self reproduction", the propensity toward the perpetuation of existing technology, which has assured sources of material supply and provides near-certain production bonuses. [....] Reliance on longstanding sources of materials supply to insure against external (to the enterprise or ministry) supply disruptions also slows technical advance.3 2 Centralized planning promises a producer an adequate allocation of necessary inputs but provides no guarantee of timely and sufficient delivery. As a result, a good deal of Soviet machinery is produced in small machine shops attached to the consuming organization rather than in large-scale machinebuilding ministries. Only the specialized ministries, however, can afford to support the research and testing facilities required to develop advanced technology. To the degree that the propensity toward vertical integration (self-sufficiency) prevails, Soviet industry forgoes the benefits of division of labor that characterize modern industry in market economies. [....] Technological backwardness is also explained by insufficient supplier initiative. In market economies, most technical progress at the plant level originates in sales pressure by equipment suppliers. The basic Soviet shortcoming is institutional. In the Soviet system, research and development is separated originally from production. The incentives for R&D organizations reward expenditures of budget allocations more than completion of projects or the satisfaction of consumer demand.

# intensive and extensive growth
until the 1980's, the USSR did not prioritize "intensive" growth: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> As both Soviet and Western observers of Soviet economic development have repeatedly said,' the traditional Soviet approach to growth has stressed the rapid infusion of labor, fixed capital, and raw materials into industry. Compared with the path followed by industrializing market economies, there has been proportionately far less effort to increase the productivity of either existing or new manpower and capital assets. Since 1960, the USSR-among the major industrial economies-has experienced the most rapid growth of employment and, along with Japan, the fastest growth of fixed capital stock. In sharp contrast, the Soviet Union has shown the lowest rate of increase in both labor and capital productivity (table 1). In official Soviet jargon the traditional approach is termed "extensive" and the alternative path of stress upon productivity as "intensive". While Soviet planners have continually accorded lip service to productivity objectives under the rubric of "hidden production reserves", they have embraced intensive development as a major policy focus only within the past decade.
as a result, the USSR invested little into factory and machine replacement or modernization: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> In the mid-1970's, 56 percent of U.S. industrial investment was directed toward replacement and modernization. In the Soviet Union the proportion was only 29 percent in the late 1970's. While the U.S. proportion may be too high a standard for the Soviet Union, given slower U.S. industrial growth, some Soviet economists had recommended that the Soviet share should be doubled or tripled. The replacement share has in fact been steadily rising during the 1981-85 Five Year Plan, reaching 35 percent in 1984. [....] The advantages of an intensified replacement effort are several fold, according to special surveys carried out in the USSR. Labor productivity is said to be about 50 percent and capital productivity 86 percent higher than in new plant construction. These results reportedly were attained with cost savings of one half to two-thirds and with capacity being brought on stream 3-3.5 times as rapidly. [....] The accelerated retirement guidelines adopted in 1975, as noted earlier, have not been implemented. Official retirements for wear and tear, as reported in the annual statistical handbook, have shown no significant change. [....] During the 1970's the average age (number of years in production) of current machinery output rose significantly. The share of new products fell from 4.3 to 2.5 percent while the share of machinery in production for more than 10 years climbed from 20 to 28 percent.

# research and development: military spending prioritized
Allen 2001: military research remained innovative while civilian research fell behind: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858784395535319040/allen2001.pdf> The increase in defence spending may have lowered productivity growth, however, by diverting R&D resources from civilian to military innovation. It is difficult to measure the rate of invention, but the available indicators suggest that it was declining in the USSR, at least for the civilian economy. The Soviets did publish considerable statistics on the number of new prototypes brought into use. While such numbers are always hard to interpret, Kontorovich ~1987, 1990! has argued that they indicate the volume of newly available technologies, and Amann ~1986! has pressed them into service. They show a decline in the absolute number of new inventions brought into use each year from the 1960s to 1985. Kontorovich ~1990, 267! has divided them into civilian and military innovations and argued that the fall was largely confined to the civilian sector. [....] If the Cold War was responsible for the drop in Soviet productivity growth, then it accounts for over half of the Soviet growth slowdown. TFP growth dropped from 1.5 per cent per year to 20.5 per cent between the 1960s and 1980–85. Reversing the productivity slowdown by adding 2 per cent to the 1980–85 GNP growth rate increases the latter from 2 to 4 per cent per year. This is still less than the 5.7 per cent growth of the 1960s, but certainly is a much better performance.
between 1950 and 1990, the USSR spent 10-20% of its GDP each year on defense (about 2x that of the USA): <https://nintil.com/2016/05/31/the-soviet-union-military-spending/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/594582157100580886/defchart.png
a subsection of the Senate report on USSR underperformance mainly blamed poor managerial incentives: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> The explanations for lagging Soviet technological progress, with its unfavorable consequences for the policy of intensive development, lie mainly in managerial incentives, the institutio nal relationships between research and development and production, and the technological drain imposed the priority given to defense production. Technological progress in market economies depends upon both consumer and supplier initiatives. In the Soviet system, the influence of the consumer is weak, except in defense production where the initiative comes from the Ministry of Defense with reinforcement from the top leadership.
about half of research and development funds and about half of new machine tools went to the defence industry: <https://www.amazon.com/Victory-Administrations-Strategy-Hastened-Collapse/dp/0871136333> The eleventh five-year plan that was being developed by the CPSU reflected this preoccupation and concern. It gave a very high priority for overcoming the perceived lag with the West in electronics. The plan called for a rise in output of industrial robots from 13,000 to 28,000 and machine tool development centers from 2,500 to 10,700. In the first two years of the new plan, investment in engineering-sector facilities for research and development, testing, and evaluation was said to be 50 percent above the funding for the whole of the previous five years. And R&D funds were to be especially concentrated on high-tech projects. **The trouble was that the best Soviet resources in the field were being directed toward the military-industrial base. Half of the machine tools were going to defense enterprises, which also employed the best scientists. At least half of all research and development expenditures were for the military. And the Reagan defense buildup—particularly its emphasis on emerging technologies—meant that more resources needed to be shifted to defense.** [....] The temper of the times meant that Gorbachev would be devoting even more to defense than had been the case in the past. The new five-year plan called for more spending on advanced weapons. **As Gorbachev would later admit, the planned rate of growth for defense in 1986 through 1990 was almost 8 percent per year, twice the rate of national income growth.22 All told, defense expenditures would rise an astonishing 45 percent in the next five years.**

Our evidence seems to support the conclusions of Allen rather than those of Wheatcroft. When two independent sources of investigation—deconvolution of adult heights on the one hand and Allen’s indices of wages and prices on the other, mutually agree, the plausibility of each is reinforced. Given however, that the deconvolution technique is new in the field, we have presented a second study using completely different data from Austria. Again we find that the inferred food availability from deconvolution conforms plausibly to other historical sources. We have come to the conclusion that it is possible to use of deconvolution to infer past diets.

There was an outbreak of malaria in 1920. The Institute of Tropical Medicine in Moscow instituted a programme of registration of cases and free distribution of quinine. The famine of 1921/2 caused widespread starvation. As many as 27 million people were affected. Another cholera outbreak between 1921 and 1923 caused an estimated 13 million deaths.

starting in the 1960's, the USSR's healthcare system was unable to handle chronic illnesses and faced systemic underfunding and shortages: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/73aiiu/what_was_healthcare_like_in_the_soviet_union/> <http://archive.is/qMwgJ> [W]hile the early Soviet healthcare system (early in this case largely means pre-WWII, and sometimes even pre-1930) was well prepared to deal with fractured bones and cholera, it was poorly equipped to deal with complicated conditions and mental illnesses. This approach, however, still allowed Russian (as it varied between national republics) life-expectancy to peak at or around 70 years in the mid 1960s, not far from the Western European averages at the time. This translates to around 64 years for men and 73 years for women (with the corresponding figures for France and the US in 1965 being approximately 67.5 and 66.8 for men, and 74.7 and 73.7 for women respectively). [....] From that point onward сardiovascular diseases became one of the primary causes of non-violent death in the Soviet Union. This is the trend that was noted across the industrialized world, with low rates of infectious diseases, and growing rates of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. [...] Increases in substance abuse also started to take a toll. The amount of resources devoted to healthcare did not increase accordingly (it is estimated that it stayed relatively constant at around 2-3% between 1960 and 1970). In comparison, in United States it increased from 5% in 1960, to around 8% in 1983. As a result of that, as well as the start of the decline of the Soviet economy as a whole, in the early 1970s Soviet Union became the only major industrialized nation that experienced a decline in life expectancy at that time (it fell to around 63-64 years in 1982), with an increase in the gap between males and females (an average male was expected to live around 10-12 years less than an average female at the time).

Fundamental change in gender roles and in the gender division of labour, including that in the household, was never seriously proposed (Posadskaya, 1994). Feminism remained a heresy, and the increase in quality and quantity of household goods and public services, constantly promised to Soviet women, remained a dream.""""""Formally, the Soviet wage-system was based on productivity -- schooling, skill, efficiency, and 'importance for the national economy'.

# sexuality liberalized substantially over time (research is low-medium quality)

And even though Soviet women had access to abortion again after 1955, the lack of birth control and the double burden of work and family responsibilities conspired to depress sexual function in many women. There is no doubt about it: for this generation, Soviet sex sucked.""""""[They] found that middle-class urban women born between 1945 and 1965 described a marked move away from the pro-natalist script. Although the pro-natalist view of sexual relations continued, it was complemented by two new ways of talking about sexuality: romance and friendship. The emergence of the romantic script was the result of a larger shift in Soviet public narratives about sexuality.""""""This romantic script of sexuality is exactly what early socialists such as August Bebel and Alexandra Kollontai would have envisioned for a society in which economic considerations had less influence on the choice of an amorous partner."""
middle-late USSR: interviews with middle-class urban Russian women suggested that, in the late Soviet period (1965-89), the key driver for sex and relationships was romance plus friendship: <https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/women-better-sex-under-socialism-review> <https://u1lib.org/book/3644970/edaf3f> <https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/_3JPDwAAQBAJ> """The other way to describe sex that began to emerge among middle-class women in the late Soviet period is the friendship script.

This friendship script presumably arose because women had access to their own resources and didn’t depend on men to provide for their material needs. Because some urban Soviet women felt secure in their economic position, sexuality lost its exchange value and became something to be shared."""
post-USSR: interviews with middle-class urban Russian women suggested that, after the fall of the Soviet Union (1991-2005), sex was re-commodified and re-coupled with material gains: <https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/11/women-better-sex-under-socialism-review> <https://u1lib.org/book/3644970/edaf3f> <https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/_3JPDwAAQBAJ> """If sexual economics theory is on the right track, you would guess that the introduction of free markets and the rapid dismantling of the social welfare state after the collapse of the USSR would precipitate a return of a worldview in which women’s sexuality is once again a commodity. And this is exactly what Temkina and Zdravomyslova found in their 1997 and 2005 interviews with women of the post-Soviet generation. In addition to the “hedonistic script,” in which sex is purely physical for the purpose of experiencing individual pleasure, often assisted by sex toys and other products that can be purchased in a capitalist economy (a script absent, for obvious reasons, in the Soviet era), they note the emergence of something they called the “instrumental script,” which became ubiquitous after the advent of free markets.""""""The commodification of women’s sexuality in Russia could be observed in the dramatic increase in sex work, pornography, strategic marriages for money, and what the authors call “sponsorship,” whereby wealthy men sponsor their mistresses.

In the middle run the new model was proven, in Europe and China, to be almost as resilient as the Western democratic forms, although less efficient for some social and economic purposes.

However, by the summer of 1937 Stalin seems to have become worried that the newly enfranchised would use their rights to challenge the regime, and that criticism of individual bureaucrats in the Party would encourage an attack on the Party itself.

# contemporary descriptions of soviet elections: brailsford
Brailsford 1927: the 1927 Soviet elections were totally devoid of any alternate parties, any opposition press, any lists of opposition candidates: <https://www.marxists.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/index.htm> <https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111615/http://www.marxistsfr.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/ch03.htm> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1169414991162646599/image.png?ex=65555194&is=6542dc94&hm=b504e727ca79f95b6681902ce670eed62ffa9ad08a58400794c19539de5dbd80& How the Soviets Work """A General Election was going on in Russia during my stay this year. Save for the reports in the news-papers, one would hardly have suspected it. Experience has bred in me a great respect for Russian achievements in every form of publicity, and I found myself searching the walls of Moscow for posters and cartoons. Nothing of the kind was to be seen. It was only after a minute search that I did discover, posted up on the door of a public building, here and there, a sober document known as a nakaz, in which the Communist Party of Moscow gave an account of its administration during the past year, concluding with the promises, couched in somewhat dry and conventional language, which in all countries are expected on these occasions. For any rival document, for any answering manifesto, for any of the competing jibes, witticisms, invectives, and slander, which in other countries are usual at such moments, one would have looked in vain. [....] When one has placed it on record that no organized political party is allowed to exist in rivalry with the Communist Party, one has said almost all that need be said about these elections. The "Left" social-revolutionary Party, and the "Mensheviks" (Minority Social Democrats), did, indeed, survive for a time as tolerated rivals during the early years of the revolutionary period, but both of them have long ago disappeared "underground." There is no organization which could compile any alternative list of candidates, and if by mischance this were to happen in one electoral area, there could be no arrangement, even by clandestine means, to present lists of candidates of like opinions all over Russia. It might be contended that in theory this possibility does exist, but without the right to issue rival newspapers freely, or to print controversial leaflets, of what value would such a right be?"""
Brailsford 1927: Soviet elections function like municipal elections, which select administrators of the state rather than its politics: <https://www.marxists.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/index.htm> <https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111615/http://www.marxistsfr.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/ch03.htm> How the Soviets Work """No large issues of policy are ever settled at a Soviet election. When necessity does require a sharp change of policy, it is invariably within the ranks of the Communist Party, and not at the elections for the Soviets, that the controversy is fought out. The business of an election is rather to choose persons who will carry out the day to day work of administration. The entire structure of the Soviet system lends itself naturally to this limitation. Only the local Soviets (the word, of course, means simply "Council") at the basis of the pyramid are directly elected by the masses of the citizens. The national and federal Soviets at the apex of the system are chosen by indirect election, and to these alone belong legislative functions and the right to approve or reject any large change in national policy. [....] The atmosphere of a Soviet Election in Moscow is, accordingly, rather nearer to that of an English municipal election than to that of a Parliamentary General Election. The problem is to choose practical men and women who will administer with good sense, in accordance with the prevailing views and interests of the electors. They must be in sympathy with the accepted system, but they are not necessarily members of the Communist Party. In the country, indeed, though rarely in the towns, the majority in the lower Soviets is usually "non-party," a phrase which usually implies some degree of sympathy with the Communist Party short of membership or the acceptance of its discipline. When one grasps these more or less inevitable limitations, the method by which the members are chosen seems rather more natural and rather less unreal."""
Brailsford 1927: gives a detailed example of how the election works within a Soviet textile factory: <https://www.marxists.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/index.htm> <https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111615/http://www.marxistsfr.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/ch03.htm> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1169414324004061204/image.png?ex=655550f5&is=6542dbf5&hm=4e15592798fef1d6f411d25a107f5106a1aac8275c656412f5ee23e62a92d939& How the Soviets Work """Let us see, then, how they voted in the "Three Hills" mill which we have already explored. [It was by accident rather than design that I chose a textile mill for study. The fighting and ruling forces of the Soviet State were drawn rather from the metal workers.] On the walls of the factory, when I visited it, some days before the actual election, two lists of candidates had been posted, who sought election to the Moscow City Soviet, and to the less important rayon (ward) Soviet. There were also shorter lists of "substitutes," who would take the places of the elected members in case of death or prolonged absence on other duties. The factory had the right to return one delegate for each 600 of its workers; its allowance was, in fact, fourteen members. [....] The remaining names were all those of workers or former workers in the factory. Seven of the fourteen were, as the list showed, members of the Communist Party; one was a member of the Communist League of Youth, and the rest were "non-party." Three of the fourteen were women. Here, then, was the official list, containing a bare majority of professed Communists presented to the Electors for their ratification. There was no alternative list. By what method had it been compiled? The first step is that each member of last year's Soviet (the elections are annual) who desires to stand again, presents a report on his or her activity. A meeting then takes place between the Works Council and three hundred delegates, who represent small groups of the various categories of workers. At this meeting names are put forward, and there often follows a thorough discussion of the record and reputation of each. There is usually a vote on each name. In this way the first draft of the official list is compiled, under the supervision of the Works Council. It then goes before separate meetings of the various crafts in the factory, and at these it may be modified. In. its final form it is a selection presented by the Works Council to a general meeting of all the workers in the factory. At this meeting it is still theoretically possible to oppose any name in the list and to put forward another name to replace it; but of this right the electors rarely avail themselves, for the good reason that the preliminary procedure by which the list is prepared, does furnish some guarantee that it corresponds, on the whole, with the wishes of the electors. They are not consciously settling big issues of national policy, nor are they even directly choosing legislators. They are choosing average, trustworthy citizens, who will see that the administrative machine of the city runs efficiently for the common good of the working population. The atmosphere of the election and, indeed, of debates in the Soviets themselves, is strangely remote from "politics" as Western democracies conceive them. A big family, animated by a single purpose, sits down on these occasions to administer its common property."""
Brailsford 1927: the unfree system of the Soviet Union resulted from its origins in a coup, in a civil war, and in bloodshed: <https://www.marxists.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/index.htm> <https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111615/http://www.marxistsfr.org/history/archive/brailsford/1927/soviets-work/ch03.htm> How the Soviets Work """The underlying fact which explains this curiosity in elections is that the political system which prevails in Russia is not open to debate. It was set up by a coup d'etat. It had next to be defended against armed opponents in the Civil War. It became the accepted basis of political and economic life, because during this civil war, after bitter experience of the alternatives, the masses of the population did on the whole rally to it, did on the whole defend it, at a terrible cost in blood and suffering, and did on the whole acquiesce in the leader-ship of the Communist Party. What was won at such a cost in life and treasure, that Party will not expose to the hazards of argument, or the chances of the voting urn. On that point the rulers of Russia are as frank as they are determined. Whether in fact a free election, preceded by an equally free period of public controversy, would result in a majority for the system, one can only conjecture. My own belief is that a decided majority would ratify it. The question, however, is academic; the experiment will never be tried."""

# collective leadership in the soviet union: cia documents and "dictatorship"
summary: One CIA report says that Stalin was not a dictator per se but rather the captain of the team of elite Soviet leaders who controlled the country. (Others call him a dictator.) It should be noted that "collective leadership" does not imply that said collective leadership was democratically selected!
CIA 1956: calls Stalin a dictator, suggests Khrushchev et al were scarred / traumatized by Stalin's dictatorship and thus returned to "collective leadership": <https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/document/cia-rdp78-02771r000200180001-7> <https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-02771R000200180001-7.pdf> THE KHRUSHCHEV ATTACK ON STALIN """The vehemence of Khrushchev's attack on Stalin before the 20th Con- gress of the CPSU suggests that Khrushchev and his colleagues bear pro- found psychological scars from their experience with the naked power of a dictator. Having lived under a common terror., they wish to pre- vent its recurrence by establishing a greater degree of collective rule. But the history of totalitarianism shows that this tenuous bal- ance of power at the top of the pyramid cannot be maintained and there is no warrant in Soviet experience for the new leaders' success."""

The Western idea of a dictat:br within the Communist setup is exaggerated. Misunderstandings on that subject are caused by lack of comprehension of the real nature and organization of the Communist power structure. Stalin, although holding wide powers, was merely the captain of a team and it seems obvious that Khrushchev will be the new captain. However, it does not appear that any of the present leaders will rise to the stature of Lenin and Stalin,so that it will be safer to assume that developments in Moscow will be along the lines of what is called collective leadership, unless Western, policies force the Soviets to stream- line their power organization.

When we speak of collective leadership, we mean a committee of a very few men, probably not more than five or six. The larger the membership, the greater the likelihood that fractionalization may occur, dividing the committee into antagonistic groups. Such developments are, of course, possible also among a few men, but in the case of the Soviet lomderv, the psychological impact of the Stalin terror probably acts as a preventive.

However, collectivization pushed up the growth rate enough in the rest of the decade to raise GDP, capital accumulation, and consumption above the 1939 levels they would have realized had the agrarian system of the 1920s been preserved. Collectivization raised growth by increasing rural-urban migration: First, low procurement prices lowered farm incomes below the level they would have otherwise reached. Migration increased in consequence, since it was a function of the ratio of urban to rural income. Second, the deportation of 'kulaks' and state terrorism in general increased the rate of rural-urban migration at every ratio of urban to rural consumption. Terrorism increased economic growth to that small degree."""

The working arrangements of all economic systems rely on incentives and norms of behaviour. The Bolshevik Revolution destroyed the old incentives and norms and struggled to replace them with new ones. Private property was confscated in successive waves from the Revolution of 1917 to the collectivisation of peasant farms, launched at the end of 1929. The waves of confscation destroyed incentives to work, to save, and to innovate. The famine of the early 1930s arose from the interplay of unexpectedly poor weather with the confscation of grain stocks to meet the needs of industrialisation. Famine and the repression that accompanied it, destroyed millions of lives. Later in the 1930s, the purges arose from the party leaders’ need to secure their regime and from Stalin’s calculation that the greatest danger to the regime arose from the ‘potential’ and even ‘unconscious’ enemies that were hiding around him and more widely in society.

It is tempting to conclude that this was due to the removal of key fgures: Pyatakov in heavy industry, Lifshits on the railways, and Mar’yasin at Gosbank. In each case the arrest of the key fgure was accompanied by a wave of arrests of their offcials.40 The less successful performance of the economy continued in the following years. The waves of arrests led to a pronounced shortage of qualifed and experienced personnel and were closely accompanied and followed by a deterioration in economic performance.41 In the coal industry, arrests of senior personnel were so extensive in the frst few months of 1937 that in March the deputy head of the Commissariat of Heavy Industry’s Chief Coal Administration complained to his superiors of the ‘complete collapse of work’ in the mine construction trust Shakhtostroi. Two months later he complained that no work had been done in the trust for fve months because the whole board of the trust had been arrested.42 Arrests were widespread throughout the industry. Coal output per day declined steadily in the months January–May 1937, and did not recover to the level of December 1936 until November 1937.43 According to David Hoffmann, who has made an extensive study of Moscow in this period, ‘labor discipline deteriorated rapidly with the onset of the purges (as shown by a marked increase in worker absenteeism and tardiness), and resulted in a substantial fall in factory production.’44"""

The level of mechanization and, more generally, working conditions, however, were very different, complicating such comparisons. Accounting for possible externalities of forced labor would make such cost-benefit analyses of forced labor even more complex (Gregory and Lazarev, eds, 2003).

Focusing on the different economic and bureaucratic cultures within the industrial system, Shearer reconstructs the debates in 1928 and 1929 over administrative, financial, and commercial reform. He uses information from recently opened archives to show that attempts by the state's trading organizations to create a commercial economy enjoyed wide support, offering a model that combined planning and rapid industrialization with social democracy and economic prosperity. In an effort to crush the syndicate movement and establish tight political control over the economy, Stalinist leaders intervened with a program of radical reforms. Shearer demonstrates that professional engineers, planners and industrial administrators in many cases actively supported the creation of a powerful industrial state unhampered by domestic social and economic constraints. The paradoxical result, Shearer shows, was a loss of control. The overly centralized system that emerged during the first Five-Year Plan was rendered incoherent by periodic economic crises and the continuing influence of partially suppressed social and market forces."""

Practically all mass literature was classified as literature that "excites, strengthens, and develops base, animal, antisocial feelings (such as spite and cruelty, [or] sexual perversion and sensations in pornographic books), superstition, national-ism and militarism (in many historical novels)." Among these were the "lubok books" (Bova Korolevich, Eruslan Lazarevich, The English Milord Georg, Frantsyl' Ventsian, Guak, or, Indomitable Loyalty, Novgorod Knight, The Witch from Beyond the Dniepr, lapancha, the Tatar Horseman, Pan Tvardovskii, and others published by the presses of Sytin, Balashov, Brilliantov, Zemskov, Konovalov, etc.); "lubok songbooks," "boulevard" and/or "crime novels" (Casanova, the Adventurer, Nat Pinkerton, Nick Carter, Battle by Air, Garibaldi, or books for example by Gaboriau or Ponson du Terrail). But when the "cleansing list" reached Russian authors, the picture became absolutely dismal: next to almost every name appeared the word "everything" (i.e., for removal) in parentheses. This included Arkadii Averchenko, Verbitskaia, M. Volkonskii, Prince Meshcherskii, Vsevolod Solov'ev, and L. Shakhovskaia, to note only some of the most widely read authors: the list contained 56 names (pp. 45-47). The hits were so precise that one would suppose the authorities were in fact struggling against the "bad tastes of the reading public." Meanwhile, an impeccable selection was sent to distill the libraries' holdings, to replace "mass literature" with "literature for the masses." Children's libraries suffered particularly badly as a result of the removals (obviously, the pedagogical predilections and pretensions of Krupskaia, who was considered not only the country's "chief librarian" but also its "chief pedagogue", were in evidence here). When children's literature was being discussed, the tone of the instructions became evasive and peremptory; in practice the evasiveness of wording led librarians to remove as much as possible, on the principle "better overzealous than negligent." The instructions insisted: "It is especially important to cleanse children's departments of the libraries of books with a bad emotional and ideological content; from them must be removed not only books with the aforementioned bias [the one noted about literature for adults] but also books that do not satisfy contemporary pedagogical requirements" (p. 47).

### effect on urban citizens: rates of death comparable to those of the rural famine regions
Davies and Wheatcroft 2010: the urban food shortage starting in 1927 led to a rationing system that covered most urban residents of the Soviet Union; this system was often insufficient for urban residents: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/916418069> <https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=32DAA2871728468189A57E0233492A3A> <https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Years_of_Hunger_Soviet_Agriculture_1/4s1lCwAAQBAJ> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1154894126274326678/DaviesWheatcroft2004.pdf> """The crisis of the state grain collections in the autumn of 1927 soon led to general urban food shortage. Rationing of major foods and some consumer goods was introduced piecemeal in the course of 1928 and 1929.24 By the end of 1930, over 30 million people were receiving food from what had become an elaborate rationing system (see vol. 3, pp. 289–300). The number of people receiving rations continued to expand, and reached 38 million by the beginning of 1932.25 However, as a result of the pressures on the state grain collections from these increased numbers, and from the demands of industry and export, it became increasingly difficult to honour the approved rations. Some commodities were taken off the ration in 1931 (see vol. 4, pp. 61–3). At the beginning of 1932, some foods were also derationed. For all these goods, the urban as well as the rural population had to fend for itself. On March 23, 1932, a fateful Politburo decision substantially reduced the allocation of grain for 20 million people on the lower-priority ration Lists 2 and 3. The local authorities were supposed to make up the difference; but in practice the amount of bread received by this huge segment of the non-agricultural population was substantially reduced. In the months before the new harvest, the urban death rate doubled in the Lower Volga region, the North Caucasus and Ukraine (see vol. 4, p. 187n.).26 Dissatisfaction was widespread. Serious food riots took place in the textile areas; and many workers who failed to receive food rations left their building sites. With the exception of some regions of Ukraine, the death rate in the towns was higher than in the countryside in the spring and early summer of 1932."""

Official figures for Soviet and Ukrainian kolkhoz yields (6.8 centners and 8.0 centners) are close to average yields for all sectors (7.0 centners and 8.1 centners). The archival figures for kolkhoz yields (6.4 centners and 5 centners) can be reasonably assumed to be close to the genuine average yields for all sectors and, therefore, kolkhoz production data in the annual reports can serve as a basis for estimating total grain production in 1932. Thus, for Ukraine, the official sown area (18.1 million hectares) reduced by the share of sown area actually harvested (93.8 percent) to a harvested area of 17 million hectares and multiplied by the average yield (approximately 5 centners) gives a total harvest of 8.5 million tons, or a little less than 60 percent of the official 14.6 million tons. This result appears to support Holubnychy's statement that 40 percent of the crop was lost in 1932. A similar calculation of the sown area in the Soviet Union (99.7 million hectares), reduced by 7 percent (based on the TsUNKhU data) to 92.72 and multiplied by the NKZ average yield of 5.4 centners, gives a total Soviet harvest of 50.06 million tons, almost 30 percent below the official figure of 69.87-within the range that Schiller predicted. If the kolkhozy that did not complete annual reports had lower harvests than those that did and if sovkhoz and edinolichnik harvests were as low as their 1932 procurements implied, the harvest may have been well below 50 million tons.3"""

It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to assess the extent to which it would have been possible for Stalin to use part of the grain stocks available in spring 1933 to feed starving peasants. The state was a monopoly supplier of grain to urban areas and the army; if the reserves of this monopoly supply system-which amounted to four-six weeks' supply-were to have been drained, mass starvation, epidemics and unrest in the towns could have resulted. Nevertheless, it seems certain that, if Stalin had risked lower levels of these reserves in spring and summer 1933, hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions-of lives could have been saved. In the slightly longer term, if he had been open about the famine, some international help would certainly have alleviated the disaster. And if he had been more far-sighted, the agricultural crisis of 1932-1933 could have been mitigated and perhaps even avoided altogether. But Stalin was not hoarding immense grain reserves in these years. On the contrary, he had failed to reach the levels which he had been imperatively demanding since 1929."""

In both cases, the regime acknowledged the crises and formed extraordinary agencies to manage relief.16 The 1928-1929 Ukrainian famine, which has not been recognized in the Western literature but is documented in Ukrainian sources, was a major cause of the "grain crisis" because it substantially reduced grain supplies for the urban population as well as for peasants in the drought regions. The grain crisis and famine of 1928-1929 were among the main factors that led Soviet leaders and officials to resort to the "extraordinary measures" to procure food from peasants in other regions, to import food from abroad, to ration food in towns and in rural famine districts, and ultimately to undertake the collectivization of agriculture.17 Even in 1930 many regions had unfavorable weather and crop failures: in parts of the North Caucasus, crop failures forced local authorities to appeal to central authorities for seed aid, which they received, and crop failures also reduced harvests in Kazakstan and the Middle Volga.18

The authorities curtailed all of these, but ultimately rural food supplies had last priority. The harsh 1932-1933 procurements only displaced the famine from urban areas, which would have suffered a similar scale of mortality without the grain the procurements provided (though, as noted above, urban mortality rates also rose in 1933). **The severity and geographical extent of the famine, the sharp decline in exports in 1932-1933, seed requirements, and the chaos in the Soviet Union in these years, all lead to the conclusion that even a complete cessation of exports would not have been enough to prevent famine. This situation makes it difficult to accept the interpretation of the famine as the result of the 1932 grain procurements and as a conscious act of genocide. The harvest of 1932 essentially made a famine inevitable. Although the low 1932 harvest may have been a mitigating circumstance, the regime was still responsible for the deprivation and suffering of the Soviet population in the early 1930s.** The data presented here provide a more precise measure of the consequences of collectivization and forced industrialization than has previously been available; if anything, these data show that the effects of those policies were worse than has been assumed. They also, however, indicate that the famine was real, the result of a failure of economic policy, of the "revolution from above," rather than of a "successful" nationality policy against Ukrainians or other ethnic groups."""

Afterward, when most peasants had already been collectivized and subjected to the procurement demands of 1931, the number of draft animals, especially horses, declined rapidly. Animals were the immediate victims of shortages in 1930-1933 since starving peasants had no choice but to feed themselves first from the dwindling reserves, and because peasants frequently expressed their resentment of collectivization by neglect and abusive treatment of socialized livestock.93"""

Треба прийняти до уваги, що облік смертності в містах майже не зазнав деформацій і тому був відносно повним. Навпаки, в селах органи ЗАГС спромоглися зареєструвати менше половини смертних випадків. Все це вказує на те, що терор голодом цілив своїм вістрям не в етнічних українців, а в сільське населення.""""""National mortality statistics for 1933 are as follows: Analyzing this table, it should be remembered that it presents both natural mortality and death from frostbite. The terror directed against the Ukrainian village captured everyone who lived in it with hunger. A greater number of deaths were registered in the forms of reporting by nationality than in the forms of natural movement (1,850.3 thousand people). The share of Ukrainians among the dead roughly corresponds to their specific weight in the rural population of the republic. The Moldavian, Polish, German and Bulgarian population lived almost entirely in the villages. Therefore, it suffered from hunger in the same proportions as Ukrainians. Jews mostly lived in cities. Therefore, mortality among them differed little from normal. The vast majority of Russians also lived in cities. Most of the dead are registered among the relatively small population in Russian villages. It should be taken into account that the record of mortality in cities was almost not deformed and therefore was relatively complete. On the contrary, in the villages, the civil registry office managed to register less than half of the deaths. All this indicates that the terror of hunger was aimed not at ethnic Ukrainians, but at the rural population."""

# history of famines in the Russian empire
Davies and Wheatcroft 2004: on the history of serious famines in Russia: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/52251306> <http://library.lol/main/329819E9CE86B9AFB7B59DC3C3E3D796> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1071574622417453087/wheatcroft2004.pdf> """Serious famines occurred in the Russian Empire and the USSR in 1891/92, 1918–22, and throughout 1930–33. The 1891/92 famine resulted in 400,000–500,000 excess deaths; and excess deaths in the famines of 1918–22 are estimated at as many as 10–14 million. The estimates of excess deaths in the Kazakh famine of 1930–33, in the rural famine of 1932–33, and the accompanying urban food shortages, range from 4.5 to 8 million. As we explain below, our own view is that both these extreme estimates are implausible, and that excess deaths probably amounted to 5.5 to 6.5 million. The rural famine of 1932–33, which is the central concern of this book, was not, of course, the last famine experienced on Soviet territory. During the Second World War, famine conditions existed over a large part of the USSR – the best-known famine taking place during the siege of Leningrad. Civilian excess deaths, resulting mainly from the deterioration in living conditions, may have amounted in all to as many as 14 million.3 In 1946–47 a further famine involved 1–1.5 million excess deaths, affecting the Moldavian republic, Ukraine and a large part of the RSFSR.4 It was only from 1948 onwards that the Soviet Union was free from large-scale famine. All famines are to some extent culturally-constructed phenomena, not intrinsically different from other food crises in their causation. Their consequences are, however, strikingly different, involving mass death to an extent qualitatively different from mere food shortages. The use of the term ‘famine’ indicates that the food crisis has passed a certain critical level and has taken on, or is threatening to take on, extraordinary consequences.5 The declaration of a famine is a call for extraordinary measures of relief, in circumstances that are recognized as threatening to cause mass deaths. But often governments fail to recognise famine, or recognise it half-heartedly."""

[....] P. I. Popov, the foundation director of the Central Statistical Administration (TsSU) was opposed to applying such corrections, but his great rival in Gosplan, V. G. Groman, was keen to accept these high corrections. When Popov was sacked in early 1926, and the Gromanovites took over control of TsSU there was an immediate 20% inflation in grain production figures making earlier estimates non-comparable with the high figures that were subsequently produced. A. E. Lossitsky, in charge of consumption data in TsSU, was an advocate of the balance method that was used to justify the large corrections that were made to grain production data at the time. Throughout the late 1920s there was a tension between the low uncorrected harvest evaluations made in the localities and the higher centrally corrected figures that were decided by political groups within the Interdepartmental Expert Soviet on grain harvest evaluations, which from 1926 was given monopoly rights over determining the size of grain harvests. There were further major struggles over harvest evaluations in 1927 and 1928 when first Osinsky was removed from the directorship of TsSU and then Groman was removed from Statplan and the Expert Soviet. By the end of 1929 the TsSU was abolished and all statistical work was transferred to other agencies: the Statistical Economic Sector of Gosplan and the Statistical Accounting Department within the people’s Commissariat of Agriculture NKZem. Objectivity was greatly eroded and ‘plan-constructivism’4 began to replace objective statistical evaluation, until at the end of 1931 a decision was made to restore the credibility and independence of a central statistical agency. In a quite extraordinary move, Osinsky (a major former oppositionist and outspoken defender of TsSU) was returned to the leadership of this agency, which was now called the Central Administration for National Economic Accounting (TsUNKhU), and there was a serious attempt to restore censuses and objective records. It was in this new spirit that the 1932 harvest evaluation was made; but the relatively favourable period of early 1932 (the neo-Nep) soon gave way to political pressure as the disaster of the 1932 harvest unfolded and as the centre tried to deny its existence. Despite the best efforts of Osinsky and his colleagues, pressure was applied to ensure that politically acceptable harvest evaluations were made. Osinsky and TsUNKhU were to receive a vygovor (an official reprimand) for publishing a table in an internal (‘official use only’) bulletin which showed that the grain harvest of 1932 was lower than planned.5"""

# why did French and British fail to sign?
Carley 1993: French and British refused to sign mutual defense with Soviets because of [1] hatred of communism, [2] fear of socialist revolution, and [3] admiration for Nazi repression of leftists: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668139308412091> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/09668139308412091> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1175681124844982312/carley1993.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1175680113082368101/image.png End of the ‘low, dishonest decade’: Failure of the Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance in 1939 """Auden's 'low, dishonest decade' began with the Great Depression and unfolded as Nazism and Stalinism oppressed Europe and Soviet Asia. The Anglo-French policy of appeasement led to the abandonment of Abyssinia, Austria and Spain and the betrayal of Czechoslovakia. Yet in spite of all this, the decade was not without moments of hope. The USSR, and especially its commissar for foreign affairs, Maxim Maximovich Litvinov, offered 'collective security', or an anti-Nazi alliance, to France and Great Britain. Paradoxically, Stalin's blood-drenched wickedness did not mean that Soviet foreign policy was wicked also. But in France and Great Britain the determination to resist fascism was sapped by hatred of bolshevism, fear of socialist revolution, and sneaking admiration for Hitler's repression of the left. Inter-war anti-bolshevism was in fact so like anti-communism after 1945 that it poses the question of when the Cold War began and whether it was a cause or an effect of war in 1939. Anti-bolshevism inspired illusions that Nazi Germany could be encouraged to expand eastward—peaceably, economically, to be sure—to run up against the USSR. The two scorpions' parlous embrace would leave France and Great Britain out of harm's way."""
Watson 2000: failure was mutual, but mostly on the British and French side, which failed to appreciate Soviet fears of encirclement or absolute military alliance to avoid solely fighting against Germany: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713663077> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/713663077> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1175681135888568411/watson2000.pdf> Molotov's Apprenticeship in Foreign Policy: The Triple Alliance Negotiations in 1939 """From the beginning, the two sides approached the negotiations differently. The Western powers believed that war could still be avoided and, if it came, the USSR, much weakened by the purges, could only function as a supply base in a long war of attrition, not as a main military participant. The USSR, which approached the negotiations with caution because of the traditional hostility of the Western powers and its fear of ‘capitalist encirclement’, had little faith either that war could be avoided or in the Polish army. It wanted a guaranteed commitment of military support in a war in which the USSR would play an aggressive role in a two-pronged attack on Germany: from France and the USSR.2 These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for a pact of mutual assistance with Britain and France whilst secretly engaging in parallel discussions with Germany for an agreement aimed against the Western democracies. Molotov has been accused both of artificially dragging out the talks with Britain and France by seizing on various inessential details to secure a successful outcome or better deal with Germany, and also of summarily breaking them off and concluding an alliance with Germany when on the verge of success with Britain and France. But the delays which Molotov caused were usually on issues essential to Soviet interests, and there appeared to be an impossible obstacle to the vital military convention with France and Britain when the agreement with Germany was signed. In contrast, the Western states, even taking into account that they had to coordinate their policy in the capital of a distant country, were dilatory in their approaches to Moscow and slow in their responses during the negotiations.3 A.J. P Taylor commented: "If British diplomacy seriously aspired to alliance with Soviet Russia in 1939, then the negotiations towards this end were the most incompetent transactions since Lord North lost the American colonies..." and compared the 67 days delay made by the British and French in their responses to Soviet proposals to the 16 days which the Soviet side took to respond.4 Similar comparisons were made by Zhdanov in Pravda, and by Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to Britain at the time of the negotiations.5""""""In May 1939 the British cabinet was still divided on the question of an alliance with the Soviet Union, and Halifax, the foreign secretary, did not want a mutual assistance pact.7 The British government, as late as March 1939, was unduly pessimistic about the USSR’s military capability following the purges,8 and a military agreement, as desired by the Soviet Union, was without precedent for Great Britain, which failed to understand the USSR’s fear of being forced to fight a war alone against Germany. These factors made it more likely that the Western powers, rather than Molotov, would prolong negotiations. But it is true that in their later stages, once commercial negotiations with Germany had begun, it was important for Soviet politicians to keep the talks with Britain and France going to put pressure on Germany."""

We have data to the effect that some 86,582 people perished in prisons between 1939 and 1951.31 (We do not yet know exactly how many died in labor colonies.) We also know that, between 1930 and 1952-1953, 786,098 "counterrevolutionaries" were executed (or, according to another source, more than 775,866 persons "on cases of the police" and for "political crimes").32 Finally, we know that, from 1932 through 1940, 389,521 peasants died in places of "kulak" resettlement.33 Adding these figures together would produce a total of a little more than 2.3 million, but this can in no way be taken as an exact number. First of all, there is a possible overlap between the numbers given for GULAG camp deaths and "political" executions as well as between the latter and other victims of the 1937-1938 mass purges and perhaps also other categories falling under police jurisdiction. Double-counting would deflate the 2.3 million figure. On the other hand, the 2.3 million does not include several suspected categories of death in custody. It does not include, for example, deaths among deportees during and after the war as well as among categories of exiles other than "kulaks."34 Still, we have some reason to believe that the new numbers for GULAG and prison deaths, executions as well as deaths in peasant exile, are likely to bring us within a much narrower range of error than the estimates proposed by the majority of authors who have written on the subject.

Generally speaking, the first stop for an arrested person was a prison, where an investigation and interrogation led to conviction or, more rarely, release.7 After sentencing, most victims were sent to one of the labor camps or colonies to serve their terms.

# on distinguishing incarceration from manslaughter from purposive killings
Wheatcroft 1996: we can divide repression into four types: short-term removal of civil liberties (short incarceration), long-term removal of civil liberties (long incarceration), permanent removal of civil liberties by death from high-mortality situation (manslaughter), permanent removal of civil liberties by intentional killing (murder): <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/854781720234557441/wheatcroft1996.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1091959339440406659/image.png """The use of the word repression alone would imply that the events in the different countries at different times were uniform and in some aggregate sense comparable. I think that this would be mistaken. For a more detailed analysis we need to distinguish between different degrees of repression at different times. We could begin with the temporary removal of civil liberties, pass through longer-term removal of civil liberties, including forced labour, and end with permanent removal of civil liberties by prematurely induced death. The latter could result from conscious action—killing, or from less conscious action--placing the victims in a situation where they are more likely to starve, or die of diseases or exhaustion, or even of harsh disciplinary action. This would be equivalent to thedistinction between murder and manslaughter, between purposive killing and death resulting from criminal neglect or irresponsibility."""
Wheatcroft 1996: the lines between these categories are vague: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/854781720234557441/wheatcroft1996.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1002811156328620042/unknown.png """This distinction between these categories of induced premature mortality is conventionally given great significance, although from the point of view of the victim the distinction may not appear all that great. In harsh disciplinary regimes the distinction would be even less clear. Harsh disciplinary action could result in deprivation of food, increased exhaustion, and reduced shelter to the point of starvation. It could also result in summary execution of prisoners for stepping out of line or 'straggling'. The environment in which these different forms of repression took place is also important. The mortality consequences of similar degrees of repression will be very different in different social environments, i.e. in times of war and in times of famine, and in societies which suffered a normally higher level of mortality."""

# executions
Wheatcroft 2013: between 1921 and 1953, a minimum of 796495 and maximum of 823456 people were sentenced to death by Soviet security service; these numbers include both "politicals", criminals, and "category 1" kulaks (a small minority): <https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199655663.001.0001/acprof-9780199655663-chapter-16> <https://u1lib.org/book/5235697/f206ee> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/854094075359526942/harris2013.pdf> XXXXX adjusting for civilian death rates would yield a figure 0.998x of that listed (ie, virtually identical)

Th e copy of the materials received by Malenkov and Khrushchev are presumably held in their personal fi les, which are still held in the Presidential Archive (AP RF). Both the archives of the Security service and the party leadership remain beyond the reach of unauthorized historians. 11 But a copy of the four summary tables prepared by Pavlov eventually found their way into the state archives (GARF) where they became available for normal historians to investigate. 12 Th is allowed historians who did not have direct access to closed archives to cite these materials directly with an archival reference. Th is location gave the source a greater degree of respectability, and added to some extent to the authority of these fi gures. But many scholars remained worried about not having direct access to these materials, in the archive where they belonged, and not being able to investigate the rest of the materials in these archives that would show how these materials were put together, and what the base materials were. 13

Wheatcroft 1996: between 1932 and 1946, a minimum of 1.05 million (recorded by Soviet security services) and maximum of 1.45 million (also including uncaptured runaways and disappearances in transit) people died in Soviet labor camps: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/09668139608412415> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/854781720234557441/wheatcroft1996.pdf> XXXXX after adjusting for civilian death rates: minimum 749 thousand, maximum 1297 thousand

The number recorded on 1 January each year is given in column one; subsequent columns present movements (deaths, liberations, arrivals, net runaways, disappearance in transit, etc.) calculated as a rate per thousand of the camp population. A maximum camp death rate is calculated which includes recorded deaths, uncaptured runaways and disappearances in transit. Not all of these categories would cover deaths, but many would. The data are fairly systematically presented for the period after 1934, when the camps were placed under the control of NKVD, but before 1934 during the OGPU period, when the level of mortality and losses through runaways was much higher, the data are far less complete. Basic data for minimum death rates are also available for 1932 and 1933.

For example, in 1935, the procurator of Dmitlag asked the USSR Procuracy whether the cases of prisoners who were being released early due to “severe, incurable or psychological illness” could be expedited. He complained that sometimes it took months for the cases of these prisoners to be processed, by which time the prisoners had often died, hurting the camp’s mortality rate."""

Deaths during transport did not get included in the official record.97 [97. Khlevniuk, History of the Gulag, 321–327.] Thus an accurate accounting of mortality in Stalin’s Gulag is enormously difficult to produce. The mortality rate most used in offi cial documents captured only deaths that occurred in Gulag medical facilities. In February 1933, Gulag chief Berman and Gulag medical-sanitation department chief Ginzburg complained that camp medical-sanitation departments were failing to record deaths that did not take place in their facilities.99 By the mid-1930s, deaths both in- and outside camp clinics and hospitals were reported. For 1935, Bamlag reported 5954 deaths in health care facilities and 998 outside them, for a total of 6952, or roughly 4 percent of its average prisoner population for the year.100"""

Methodologically, this claim is in ferred from this one indicator, and Alexopoulos interprets “physical labor capability” assuming the very worst for all prisoners but those classed as healthiest. Thus, she extends the camps’ mortality rate to encompass those whose lives were shortened by Gulag toil (244), a laudable moral choice, but one with obvious methodological difficulties. How do we decide which “deaths after release” to include? If it were possible to obtain it, substantiation from local and regional sources for such a count would be needed.

Getty 1993: a minority of GULAG forced laborers were criminals: just 20.6% in 1934, 27.8% in 1936, and 17.3% in 1940 were sentenced for a crime, and just 4.7% in 1934, 5.5% in 1936, and 5.2% in 1940 for a "crime against persons" <https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/98/4/1017/126966> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1086/ahr/98.4.1017> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/855104448186548264/getty1993.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/855118189070909450/unknown.png It is commonly believed that most of the prisoners of the "Gulag Archipelago" had been arrested and sentenced for political offenses falling under one of the headings of "counterrevolutionary offenses" (Article 58 in the criminal code). It is also common wisdom that many people arrested for other reasons were accused of political crimes for propaganda value. The available evidence does not bear out this view, but it does suggest considerable ambiguity in definitions of "political crimes." Table 7 shows the breakdown of labor camp inmates for selected years, according to the offense for which they were sentenced. Although the presence of alleged counterrevolutionaries is impressive, it turns out that ostensibly non-political detainees heavily outnumbered "politicals."

The first group amongst these were probably the Koreans who were forceably removed from the Russian Far East in 1937.45 A few years later the category was greatly increased to include deportations and executions associated with the occupation of the Baltic States and Eastern Poland between 1939 and 1941. At the beginning of the war, on 28 August 1941, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR ordered the ethnic Germans from the Volga area to be be forceably exiled to the Novosibirsk, Omsk and Altai regions and to Kazakhstan.46 Later during the war other nationalities were deported from newly liberated areas; these included the Kalmyks (26 359 families of 93 139 persons in October 1943), the Karachai (14 774 families of 69 938 persons in November 1943), the Chechen and Ingush (450 000 persons in February 1944) and the Tartars from Crimea. The main nationalities still held in the places of special exile in October 1946 are listed in Table 8. Unfortunately, so far data have not been made available to allow mortality rates amongst these later, primarily ethnic, spetspereselentsy to be calculated.

These unfortunate beings were the only kulaks to be included in these records of the investigative organs. Similarly most of the exiles of ethnic groups from certain areas were to be performed without the use of the investigative organs, as were the Katyn executions. It should be noted, however, that the mass arrests and executions of the Anti-Soviet Element campaign 00447, and the ethnic campaigns of 1937–8 were all supposed to be carried out with the use of individual investigations from the investigative agencies, and in that sense they were not mass operations, and would be included in these records."""
Wheatcroft 2009: mass operations that did not use individual investigations were not included in the security statistics; Katyn and category 2 and 3 kulaks fall into this category: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014498308000259> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.eeh.2008.06.002> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858949796580163584/wheatcroft2009.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/895009735198261348/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/895009782707159070/unknown.png "The resulting Pavlov figures have often been cited as if they were some overall summary of all repressive activities of the Security forces, rather than as the operational accounting data of the investigative organs. The claims that these data are clearly false because they fail to include all dekulakised kulaks, or the Katyn killings are invalid. Category 2 and 3 kulaks in 1930 and 1931 were ordered to be exiled without referring their cases to the investigative organs. And the Polish officers and intellectuals in 1940 were similarly processed and shot on the basis of the documents used for their arrest, without further investigations. [....] The only Security force data that we have are for cases passing through the investigative organs. We do not have any data for extrajudicial executions carried out without the involvement of the investigative agencies. These were mass operations in a specific sense in which sentences were imposed after arrest without further investigation. These were relatively rare cases during peacetime, but more regular in martial law circumstances, and in newly occupied areas. The Katyn massacre of 25,000 Polish officers and members of the intelligentsia in 1940 belongs to this category."

True enough, but not when every one of those accusations has been extracted through torture and the defendants are told what to say in order to bring a halt to their suffering.""""""There is no evidence of Rudzutak’s innocence, Furr argues, because the Khrushchev-era Pospelov rehabilitation report [....] did not disprove the charges made against Rudzutak[.]""""""“If exculpatory evidence existed, why did they not cite it?” (57). This rather misses the point of a report and a speech. Both would extend to unwieldy length were they to address every detail. Furr also fails to recognize the impossibility of proving a negative. How can one confirm that the outlandish charges made against Rudzutak were false? Can one prove that an individual did not commit sabotage, for example? It is more meaningful to note the total lack of evidence in support of the charges."""
Elich 2014: on "Khrushchev lied" and the Great Purge: Yezhov example: <https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/pdf/10.1521/siso.2014.78.3.390> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1521/siso.2014.78.3.390> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/969641635640143942/unknown.png """Khrushchev charged that Yezhov could not have arrested and shot so many prominent party officials without Stalin’s decision. Furr confirms that Yezhov had many innocent people tortured and killed, but says that Stalin blamed Yezhov and quotes him as describing Yezhov as a “scoundrel” who “ruined our best cadres” (304). After the arrest of Yezhov for his excesses, the total number of arrests and executions dropped sharply. Although the scale paled in comparison to 1937–38, there were still nearly 169,000 individuals arrested in 1939–40. This hardly constituted an end to repression.""""""It is too much to suppose that Stalin could not have seen anything amiss until the end of 1938, had he not set the repression in motion and looked favorably upon its progression. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to overlook the fact that the majority of his comrades in the Central Committee were being arrested and killed, with each accusation more improbable than the last. Nor could he have overlooked more than 1.5 million arrests and nearly 700,000 executions in the period 1937–38. The arrest of Yezhov had more to do with a policy change and a shifting of blame, than with a sluggish dawning of recognition."""

# growth: reparations
reparations were extremely expensive: <http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-5098.html> The reorientation and restructuring of the East German economy would have been difficult in any case. The substantial reparations costs that the Soviet Union imposed on its occupation zone, and later on East Germany, made the process even more difficult. Payments continued into the early 1950s, ending only with the death of Stalin. According to Western estimates, these payments amounted to about 25 percent of total East German production through 1953.

They found that the East German women said they enjoyed sex more and reported a higher rate of orgasm than their Western counterparts. In 1990, another study comparing the sexual attitudes of youth in the two Germanys found that GDR men’s and women’s preferences were more in sync with each other than those of young men and women in the West. For example, one survey found that 73 percent of East German women and 74 percent of East German men wanted to get married. In contrast, 71 percent of women in the West desired marriage, but only 57 percent of Western men did, a fourteen-point difference. A different survey about sexual experiences uncovered much higher levels of self-reported sensual enjoyment among East German women. When asked if their last tryst had left them feeling satisfied, 75 percent of GDR women and 74 percent of GDR men said yes, compared to 84 percent of FRG men and a mere 46 percent of FRG women. Finally, respondents were asked to report whether they felt “happy” after sex. Among the East German women 82 percent agreed, whereas among West German women only 52 percent reported feeling “happy.” To reverse that statistic, only 18 percent of GDR females were not “happy” after sex, compared to almost half of the surveyed females in the FRG."""

Most of the increased revenue was a result of the nationalization and associated policy changes, including a doubling of production by 2013. 9

Deposits have grown at an average yearly rate of 14 percent (between 2008 and 2019) even with a relative slowdown in the last couple of years (5.9 percent in 2018 and 3.4 percent year-over-year as of June 2019).19 [....] Directed lending for productive sectors and low interest rate ceilings are part of the toolkit successfully deployed by the monetary authorities.21 Total credit in the financial system has grown at an average of 16 percent per year since 2008.22

# deficit spending
deficit spending has increased, but is relatively small: <http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/new-report-reviews-changes-in-bolivia-s-economy-under-evo-morales-s-presidency> <http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191113010826/http://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/bolivia-macro-2019-10.pdf> Bolivia’s government budget deficit averaged just 1.5 percent of GDP annually between 2006 and 2018. However, between 2015 and 2018, the average annual budget deficit grew to 7.5 percent of GDP; on average, 4.3 percentage points of the deficit were financed internally by the Central Bank.26 From 2005 to 2017, the Bolivian government increased social spending by 80 percent in real terms.

# social spending

[....] Bolivia’s government has directed large amounts of resources to social spending, especially cash transfers targeted toward vulnerable sectors of the population. The three most important transfer programs are Juancito Pinto, a grant to families with children that is designed to incentivize children’s school attendance; Juana Azurduy, which gives funds to uninsured new mothers as an incentive for them to seek medical care during and after their pregnancies, in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality; and Renta Dignidad, which provides grants for those over the age of 60. These cash transfer programs translate into increased consumer spending and sustained reduction of extreme poverty. In 2018, 5.8 million Bolivians — 51.8 percent of the population — received a direct government cash transfer.29 [....] However, it is arguable that the government could have done even more for the poor. As a percent of GDP, social spending actually decreased between 2005 and 2013, though it has since risen to 12.7 percent of GDP, up from 12.4 percent of GDP in 2005.30

The poverty rate is below 35 percent (down from 60 percent in 2006), and the extreme poverty rate is 15.2 percent (down from 37.7 percent in 2006).35

# not socialist: investment
discussion of investment and socialism in Venezuela: <https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/the-tragedy-of-venezuela/> """What went wrong with the laudable aims of Chavismo? Could this tragedy been avoided? Well, yes, if the Chavista revolution had not stopped at less than halfway, leaving the economy still predominantly in the control of capital. Instead, the Chavista and Maduro governments relied on high oil prices and huge oil reserves to reduce poverty, while failing to transform the economy through productive investment, state ownership and planning. Between 1999 and 2012 the state had an income of $383bn from oil, due not only to the improvement in prices, but also to the increase in the royalties paid by the transnationals. However, this income was not used transform the productive sectors of the economy. Yes, some was used to improve the living standards of the most impoverished masses. But there was no plan for investment and growth. Venezuelan capital was allowed to get on with it – or not as the case may be. Indeed, the share of industry in GDP fell from 18% of GDP in 1998 to 14% in 2012."""

# food
report: <http://cepr.net/blogs/the-americas-blog/the-media-venezuela-and-hunger-statistics-a-case-study-in-careless-reporting> US newspapers and journals often attribute their Venezuelan hunger figures to “a recent survey … by the country’s leading universities.” The survey in question was published on February 27, 2016 by Simón Bolívar University, the Central University of Venezuela, and the Bengoa Foundation. The report, which focuses on Venezuelan nutrition, is part of an annual review covering the state of living conditions in the country. Maritza Landaeta-Jiménez, who as recently as 2013 was a member of the Venezuelan opposition’s Nutrition Commission, headed the 2016 research. **The document, based on a survey of 6,413 Venezuelans, reported that 93 percent of Venezuelans felt that they did not have enough money to purchase food, and that 72.7 percent of Venezuelans had lost an average of 8.7 kilograms (19 pounds) in the past year. However, the same survey revealed that 67.5 percent of Venezuelans were eating three meals a day, and only 25 percent of the country felt that their nutrition could be categorized as “deficient.”**
shortages: <https://nacla.org/news/2016/11/03/hunger-venezuela-look-beyond-headlines> When Venezuelan economist and Universidad Simón Bolívar professor Pasqualina Curcio put these claims to the test in her extensive investigation of the country’s current economic situation, she had some interesting findings. First, several of the missing products have not been regulated since 2010, and among those that are regulated, the government has raised prices in an effort to incentivize distributors several times recently, but this has not resulted in increased availability. Second, the shortages began to intensify in 2013, before oil prices plummeted and while dollars were still readily available. Even once oil prices dropped and dollars became less available, the government continued to prioritize dollars for food import, and by their own accounting, the production levels of Venezuela’s major food companies have been stable or have even increased in that time. Curcio also found a correlation between intensity of food shortages and politically important moments, such as the lead-up to elections. Could it be that the shortages are manufactured? Many food sovereignty activists see it as no coincidence that Polar, the country’s largest food company, responsible for many of the items missing from shelves, is owned by a well-known member of the political opposition to the government.

food security data in detail: http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/en/ (see metadata sheets)
food balance sheets data: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CC
food security methodology: <http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/fs-methods/fs-methods1/en/> Parameters to characterize the distribution of food consumption employed to estimate the PoU are derived from different sources. To compute per mean or per capita DEC at a national level, FAO relies on Food Balance Sheets. The latest data from this source refer to 2011; therefore, additional sources were needed to estimate the DEC for the last 3 years, from 2012-14. The main source for 2012 and 2013 estimates were projections prepared by the Trade and Market Division of FAO. The Holt-Winters distributed lag model was instead used to project the DEC for 2014. In some cases, the same model was applied to compute projections also for 2012 and 2013, when data from the Trade and Market Division were not available. The Holt-Winters model uses a process known as exponential smoothing, which attributes higher weights to the more recent data and progressively less weight to the older observations. Weights decrease in each period by a constant amount, which lies on an exponential curve. For countries showing peculiar patterns, other simpler forecasting models were used, such as linear or exponential trends.
food balance methodology: http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X9892E/X9892e01.htm#P78_13383 Food balance sheets are assembled form a variety of sources. The quality of the balance sheets and their coverage vary considerably among countries and commodities. Inaccuracies and errors may be introduced at each stage of a balance sheet's construction. The user of these data must therefore bear in mind their limitations. Ideally, the basic data required for the preparation of food balance sheets should be obtained from the same source. This implies that, firstly, the country should have a comprehensive statistical system which records all current information relating to each component of the food balance sheet (starting from producers to consumers). Secondly, concepts of the information adopted should be those of the food balance sheet concepts. Thirdly, the information available should be consistent, at least with respect to measurement unit and time reference period. In practice, however, such an ideal statistical system does not exist. Even in the few, mainly developed, countries which possess uncommonly sophisticated reporting procedures, the available data do not always meet either the second or third condition. Therefore, in practice, the basic data are necessarily based on a large variety of sources. The main sources commonly used are discussed below. Production and trade data are part of the ongoing national official statistics. They are based either on direct enquiries or records, or are estimated by Government agencies. Information on stock changes is available from marketing authorities and factories or from farmer stock surveys. Information on industrial uses are obtained from industrial/manufacturing censuses/surveys. Feed and seeding rates are obtained from cost of production surveys or are estimated by the Government agencies concerned. Losses occurring in industrial processing are also obtained from manufacturing surveys.

# elections
1998 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
1998 election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc874.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf> Overall, the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government observers expressed enthusiasm about the election process and were impressed by the technology involved in the automation of the vote. Problems were reported in only 16 of 252 voting sites visited, and most of these would not affect the results of the elections. The delegates found voters, poll workers, party witnesses, and soldiers worked together harmoniously to make this a transparent and peaceful election that clearly reflected the will of the Venezuelan people.
2000 Presidential + National Assembly election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Venezuelan_general_election>
2000 election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1013.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/297.pdf> We congratulate the Venezuelan people for their enthusiastic participation in yesterday´s elections. We are extremely impressed with citizens´ desire to exercise their right to vote and commend them on their patience and peacefulness. Our delegates found political party witnesses in almost all voting sites, representing a variety of parties at the national and local levels. In addition, the voting table workers had the basic knowledge necessary, worked diligently to instruct the voters on properly completing the ballots, and strived to overcome the difficulties of this complicated election process.
2000 election, Organization of American States: <http://www.oas.org/sap/publications/2000/moe/venezuela/pbl_30_2000_eng.pdf> The election campaign was conducted in an overall framework of freedom of expression, pluralism, and a high degree of public participation, fostered by the diversity of candidates, party backed and independent, and by the efforts of campaigners to mobilize the public, at the national as well as at the state and municipal levels.
2004 Presidential recall referendum: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Venezuelan_recall_referendum>
2004 recall referendum, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc1821.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1820.pdf> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1834.pdf> <https://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1837.pdf> The second audit showed a high accuracy of the voting machines with discrepancies of less than 0.1 percent. The sample was analyzed, and it does not have different properties than the universe. The sample generation program was analyzed as part of the 2nd audit process and again in this study. Both studies showed that the sample does not operate on a subset of the universe, thus hiding or masquerading some of the properties of the universe. Consequently the results of the 2nd audit accurately confirm the electoral results of Aug. 15.
2005 National Assembly election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Venezuelan_parliamentary_election>
2006 election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
2006 election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/democracy/venezuela_2006_eng.pdf> In response to an invitation from the Venezuelan National Electoral Council (CNE), The Carter Center organized a specialized, technical mission to observe the use of automated voting technology employed in the Dec. 3, 2006, presidential elections in Venezuela.

2007 constitutional referendum, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela_120307.html> Venezuelan citizens responded on Dec. 2 in a peaceful and orderly way to the referendum convoked by the National Electoral Council (CNE) to approve or reject the proposal to reform the National Constitution, presented to the citizens by the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. With 90 percent of the vote counted, the CNE declared the referendum defeated, and immediately thereafter President Hugo Chávez Frías accepted the results on national television.
2010 election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Venezuelan_parliamentary_election> 
2012 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
2012 Presidential election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-2012-election-study-mission-final-rpt.pdf> The 2012 presidential elections in Venezuela won by Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías reflected and reinforced the intense political contestation and social polarization Venezuelans have grown accustomed to since Chávez was first elected to the presidency in December 1998. Fortunately, tensions did not boil over and voting took place peacefully amid the high stakes election on Oct. 7, 2012. [....] Even so, isolated claims of fraud surfaced after the vote. Nevertheless, the whole opposition leadership, including, most importantly, Capriles himself, unequivocally rejected those claims, stating that the results reflected the will of the electorate. [....] Because the Center did not have an election observation mission in Venezuela, this report is not a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the electoral process as a whole. The report is based on the interviews conducted, the reports of national observer organizations, an analysis of Venezuelan laws and regulations, and a digest of personal observations from a nine-month monitoring period.
2013 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
2013 Presidential election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela-070313.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-final-rpt-2013-elections.pdf> As the high turnout and many opinion polls demonstrate, the Venezuelan population, and the political parties and candidates in gene	ral, have confidence in the performance and integrity of the automated touch-screen voting machines. As the postelection citizen verification audits of 100 percent of the voting machines demonstrated, the automated system functioned as expected in recording the votes cast, transmitting, and counting them on April 14. There was not agreement, however, about the quality of the voting conditions and guarantees that every registered voter is able to vote one time, and only one time. In stark comparison to the October election, when the Capriles campaign and the MUD opposition coalition questioned the conditions of competition, after the April election they also questioned the conditions of voting, a heightened criticism that went to the heart of the system’s legitimacy.
2015 election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Venezuelan_parliamentary_election>
2018 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Venezuelan_presidential_election>

Jimmy Carter, 2012: <http://web.archive.org/web/20120923221123/http://cartercenter.org/news/multimedia/Conversations/30-years-of-the-carter-center.html> https://youtu.be/VPKPw4t6Sic?t=2629 Some of the problems that John mentioned are serious, but I think the elections in Venezuela; although some people have criticized the result, which is Hugo Chavez having won. There is no doubt in my mind, having monitored very closely the election process, that he won fairly and squarely. As a matter of fact, of the 92 elections we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.

# media
from 2000 to 2010, government media averaged just 3% audience share: <http://cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf> As can be seen from the table, as of September 2010, Venezuelan state TV channels had just a 5.4 percent audience share. Of the other 94.6 percent of the audience, 61.4 percent were watching privately owned television channels, and 33.1 percent were watching paid TV. Since the private TV owners are mostly against the government, it is clear that more than 94 percent of the TV that is seen by Venezuelans is not progovernment. In fact, much of the private media is stridently antigovernment, in ways that go beyond the boundaries of what is permitted in the United States, for example. There are no data that describe the breakdown of audience share of the various TV channels on the basis of political bias. However, it is clear from this data, based on household surveys over a 10-year period, that statements about the Venezuelan government “controlling” or “dominating” the media are not only exaggerated, but simply false.
in the 2013 election, the opposition candidate Capriles routinely received more airtime than Maduro: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-final-rpt-2013-elections.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/547505802416619521/unknown.png

# economy: sabotage
the CIA funded the truckers and taxi strikes that crippled the Chilean economy: <https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/20/archives/cia-is-linked-to-strikes-in-chile-that-beset-allend> The Central Intelligence Agency secretly financed striking labor unions and trade groups in Chile for more than 18 months before President Salvador Allende Gossens was overthrown, intelligence sources revealed today. They said that the majority of more than $8 million authorized for clandestine C.I.A. activities in Chile was used in 1972 and 1973 to provide strike benefits and other means of support for anti‐Allende strikers and workers. [....] Among those heavily subsidized, the sources said, were the organizers of a nationwide truck strike that lasted 26 days in the fall of 1972, seriously disrupting Chile's economy and provoking the first of a series of labor crises for President Allende. Continue reading the main story Direct subsidies, the sources said, also were provided for a strike of middle‐class shopkeepers and a taxi strike among others, that disrupted the capital city of Santiago in the summer of 1973, shortly before Mr. Allende was over thrown by a military coup. At its peak, the 1973 strikes involved more than 250,000 truck drivers, shopkeepers and professionals who banded to gether in a middle‐class move ment that, many analysts have concluded, made a violent overthrow inevitable.
shop-owners and the USA both worked to create an artificial shortage of food: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106>: The march protested shortages of foodstuffs and a distribution system that generated long lines of shoppers waiting to buy basic products at controlled prices. The shortages themselves were a product of conservative obstruction, as store owners took items off the shelves and sold them on the black market; the opposition media created panic-buying by reporting on shortages that did not (yet) exist, and Washington instituted an “invisible blockade” by denying credit to the UP government.
the IMF, acting for US interests, largely blocked loan requests from Chile: <http://michael-hudson.com/2003/10/chiles-failed-economic-laboratory/> After Pinochet was installed, the IMF and World Bank restructured Chilean debt on much more favorable terms than those afforded Allende, and foreign banks returned almost overnight.
the IMF was more than happy to give big loans to Pinochet: <https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/05/business/chile-is-expected-to-get-900-million-imf-loan.html> <https://archive.fo/lFaBw>

# CIA opposition
the CIA funded the 1964 election: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> "The CIA sweetened the alliance, providing an estimated $4 million of covert assistance to Frei and stood behind the PDC’s scare campaign designed to play to women voters, intimating that if Allende won, they stood to lose their children, their homes, and even the concept of motherhood itself."
the CIA planned to sabotague Allende's presidency: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> A smooth transition was further undermined by the Nixon Administration’s determination to block Allende. As part of a broader scheme, the CIA supplied a group of right-wing plotters with arms and funding to kidnap the constitutionalist Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General René Schneider, an outrage to be blamed on the Left and designed to prod the military into action against Allende.45 The plot failed, Schneider was killed, and on October 24, Congress elected the UP’s candidate. But intransigent opposition to Allende from Washington, the National Party, and an emerging paramilitary right, together with Christian Democratic distrust, suggested how demanding would be his task ahead.
the CIA funded the 1970 election: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> With polling predicting an Alessandri victory, and the CIA funding a spoiling operation designed to raise fears of Allende, Washington expected voters would again reject the socialist.

Members of the party’s Central Committee, having declared the party Marxist-Leninist in 1967, opposed Allende’s selection, but the rank-and-file and regional party heads were firm in their support for the only person they thought could unite the left. In January 1970, the UP named him their candidate. It was, the Communist’s Luís Corvalán dryly observed, “a forceps birth.”
Allende's economic policy was aimed at increasing democratic support: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> Allende’s approach tightly entwined economic and political policy. An economy that expanded through Keynesian demand-side measures, advanced national producers at the expense of multinational firms and small businesses over monopolies, turned land over to peasant cultivators, and redistributed income, would also, he predicted, engender support at the polls. With enough time, he could introduce a plebiscite allowing the constitutional changes needed to give him the authority to further expand state control of the economy, create a single legislative chamber, and reform the judiciary.
Allende refused to use military power to implement his goals: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> When Army General Roberto Viaux revolted against Frei in 1969, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party called on workers “not to defend the bourgeois institutional order, but [instead] to mobilize around their own social and political demands.” Allende vigorously dissented and rushed to the Moneda to show his support for the President.66 And yet, Allende’s conviction that the military must respect the constitutional order was not shared by his conservative opponents. Even before Allende was elected, Jorge Alessandri, in a May 1970 campaign speech, had called on the “patriotic” military to intervene as needed “to save the liberty that we so love” from those who hold “criminal doctrines.”67

# economy: "socialism", privatization, re-nationalization
the 1982 crash was partially caused by and worsened by privatization: <https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/nov/22/observerbusiness.theobserver> """Pinochet did not destroy Chile's economy all by himself. He had the help of academia's most brilliant minds: a gaggle of Milton Friedman's trainees, the Chicago Boys. Under their spell, the General abolished the minimum wage, outlawed union bargaining, privatised the pension system, abolished all taxes on wealth and business profits, slashed public employment, privatised 212 industries and 66 banks and ran a fiscal surplus. Free of the dead hand of bureaucracy, taxes and unions, the country took a giant leap... into bankruptcy and depression. After nine years of Chicago-style economics, Chile's industry keeled over and died. [....] The Chicago Boys persuaded the junta that removing restrictions on the nation's banks would free them to attract foreign capital to fund industrial expansion. Pinochet sold off the state banks - at a 40 per cent discount against book value. They fell into the hands of two conglomerate empires, controlled by speculators Javier Vial and Manuel Cruzsat. Using these banks, Vial and Cruzat bought up manufacturers, then leveraged these assets with loans from foreign investors panting for their piece of the state giveaway. By 1982, the pyramid finance game was up. The Vial and Cruzat 'Grupos' defaulted. Industry shut down, private pensions became worthless, and the currency swooned. Riots and strikes by a population too desperate to fear bullets forced Pinochet to boot out his beloved Chicago experimentalists."""
after the crash, Pinochet moved back towards "socialism" (re-nationalization of the copper firms): <https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/nov/22/observerbusiness.theobserver> Reluctantly, the General restored the minimum wage and collective bargaining. Having previously decimated the ranks of state employees, he authorised a programme to create 500,000 jobs. Chile was pulled from depression by dull old Keynesian remedies, all Franklin Roosevelt, zero Margaret Thatcher. (The junta even instituted what is today South America's only law restricting the flow of foreign capital.) New Deal tactics rescued Chile from the panic of 1983, but the nation's long-term recovery and growth is the result of (cover the children's ears) a large dose of socialism. To save the nation's pension system, Pinochet nationalised banks and industry on a scale unimagined by Salvador Allende. The General expropriated at will, offering little or no compensation. While most were eventually reprivatised, the state retained ownership of one industry: copper. For nearly a century, copper has meant Chile and Chile has meant copper. Dr Janet Finn, metals expert at the University of Montana, remarks: 'It's absurd to describe a nation as a miracle of free enterprise when the engine of the economy remains in government hands.' (And not just any government: a Pinochet law, still in force, gives the military 10 per cent of state copper revenues.) Copper has provided between 30 and 70 per cent of the nation's export earnings. This is the hard currency that has built today's Chile. The proceeds from the mines seized from Anaconda and Kennecott in 1973 was Allende's posthumous gift to his nation. Agribusiness was the second locomotive of the Allende years. According to Professor Arturo Vasquez of Georgetown University, Washington DC, Allende's land reform, the break-up of feudal estates (which Pinochet could not fully reverse), created a new class of productive tiller-owners who, along with corporate and co-operative operators, now bring in a stream of export earnings to rival copper.

# biden and the 1994 crime bill
background from Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act> """The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, H.R. 3355, Pub.L. 103–322 is an Act of Congress dealing with crime and law enforcement; it became law in 1994. It is the largest crime bill in the history of the United States and consisted of 356 pages that provided for 100,000 new police officers, $9.7 billion in funding for prisons and $6.1 billion in funding for prevention programs, which were designed with significant input from experienced police officers.[1] Sponsored by Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the bill was originally written by Senator Joe Biden of Delaware and then was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton."""
opinion polling: passage of the crime bill was preceded by a significant increase in the belief that crime was the "most important" issue and followed by a substantial decrease in said belief: <https://cdn.ymaws.com/counciloncj.org/resource/resmgr/crime_bill/overview_and_reflections.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/732991338059923486/unknown.png
opinion polling: most black voters and many black representatives (28 of 41) supported the 1994 crime bill: <https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/steve-chapman/ct-column-biden-booker-crime-1994-chapman-20190726-lihqcq7qhbffnfu57lyktyjdl4-story.html> """A 1994 Gallup survey found that 58% of African Americans supported the crime bill — compared with 49% of whites. The only black senator, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, supported it. Of the 40 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, just 12 voted against it."""
at the time, most Americans and most black people supported the conservative elements of the 1994 crime bill; this must be contextualized in the 1960-1990 crime wave and the constant drumbeat of news coverage of that crime wave: <https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/162844> """It is no wonder that many African Americans had started to embrace punitive prescriptions by 1994. In the General Social Survey, black support for the death penalty for individuals convicted of murder increased from 39 percent in 1980 to 53.5 percent in 1992. African Americans certainly supported rehabilitation more than whites and desired gun control. Many were also clear-eyed about racial disparities in the criminal justice system. According to a 1994 Los Angeles Times poll, 43 percent of African Americans believed that stricter laws and prison sentences would increase discrimination against minority groups. Still, concern about racism and liberal tendencies did not curtail black support for punishment. In that same poll, 71 percent of blacks said that juveniles who commit crimes should be treated as adults, and 67 percent supported proposals that would require “any criminal convicted of three violent felonies be imprisoned for life without the possibility of parole.” Other surveys confirm these trends. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC survey, majorities of racial minorities supported adding 100,000 more police officers on the streets, allowing juveniles as young as 14 to be tried as adults when accused of a serious crime, and making more offenses eligible for the death penalty. A 1994 Time/CNN poll showed that, while only 33 percent of African Americans supported stop and frisk, 64.5 percent favored “life imprisonment for anyone convicted of three serious crimes” and 79 percent supported a 10pm curfew for children under the age of 18. Based her analysis of this survey, Katherine Tate, an expert on African American politics at Brown University, concluded that black opinion “favored the conservative elements of Clinton’s crime bill.”"""
Gallup: 1994 saw highest support for "more law enforcement" as approach to lowering crime: <https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/732993039794176060/unknown.png

Congressman John Conyers, the dean of the Congressional Black Caucus and then-chair of the House Judiciary Committee, led an effort to promote an alternative crime bill, deriding prison expansion as a “simplistic approach to the crime problem.” The Black Caucus bill emphasized support for crime prevention programs, drug treatment, and creating job opportunities.

each of trump's tariffs increased import prices by between 5% and 25%: <https://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/papers/CEPR-DP13564.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/571381550395031571/unknown.png Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We also see similar patterns for foreign countries who have retaliated against the U.S., which indicates that the trade war also reduced real income for other countries.

# foreign policy
trump is no pacifist: https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/09/donald-trump-is-dropping-bombs-at-unprecedented-levels/ Judging from Trump’s embrace of the use of air power [...] he is the most hawkish president in modern history. Under Trump, the United States has dropped about 20,650 bombs through July 31, or 80 percent the number dropped under Obama for the entirety of 2016. At this rate, Trump will exceed Obama’s last-year total by Labor Day. In Iraq and Syria, data shows that the United States is dropping bombs at unprecedented levels. In July, the coalition to defeat the Islamic State (read: the United States) dropped 4,313 bombs, 77 percent more than it dropped last July. In June, the number was 4,848 — 1,600 more bombs than were dropped in any one month under President Barack Obama since the anti-ISIS campaign started three years ago. In Afghanistan, the number of weapons released has also shot up since Trump took office. April saw more bombs dropped in the country since the height of Obama’s troop surge in 2012. That was also the month that the United States bombed Afghanistan’s Mamand Valley with the largest non-nuclear bomb ever dropped in combat.

Grumbach 2022 preprint: differences-in-differences: Rep trifectas causally decrease the Democracy Index, a measure of democratic performance (composed mostly of gerrymandering metrics, composed less of voter disenfranchisement & voting difficulty metrics) by 1 point, which fully explains the difference between Rep and Dem or mixed states: <https://sites.google.com/view/jakegrumbach/working-papers> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/983851175172517928/grumbach2022.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/983851909767127060/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/983851841248968765/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/983851990205480980/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/983852464396730450/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1103921514774020116/image.png Laboratories of Democratic Backsliding """In this article, we use the State Democracy Index to test a set of prominent theories of the causes of democratic expansion and backsliding in the U.S. Drawing on American and comparative democracy literatures, we develop predictions about the drivers of democratic expansion and backsliding. We estimate the effects of political competition, polarization, and racial demographic change on states’ democratic performance. The results suggest that none of these factors is central to dynamics in state democratic performance. Republican control of state government, however, consistently and profoundly reduces state democratic performance during this time period."""

# rising illiberal rhetoric
Lührmann Medzihorsky Lindberg 2021: the Republican Party has adopted increasingly illiberal (anti-pluralist) rhetoric and policy positions; it is closer to the illiberal parties of Orban's Fidesz, Modi's BJP, Erdogan's AKP, or Bolsonaro's PSL: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3813132> <https://v-dem.net/media/publications/working_paper_116_final.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/982108076524048435/luhrman2021.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/982108258363908136/unknown.png
Lührmann Medzihorsky Lindberg 2021: this results from the fact that the Republican Party's rhetoric and policy positions have shown increasingly lack of commitment to democracy, disrespect of minority rights, demonization of opponents, and encouragement of violence:: <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3813132> <https://v-dem.net/media/publications/working_paper_116_final.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/982108076524048435/luhrman2021.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/982109180485845005/unknown.png

# procedure: house vote
CLAIM: the impeachment inquiry is invalid because the House did not vote to open it: <https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-Letter-10.08.2019.pdf> """Your inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process. In the history of our Nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step."""
reality: the House voted 232-196 for impeachment inquiry: <https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/31/takeaways-houses-impeachment-inquiry-vote/> <http://archive.is/wip/o8ytu>
REALITY: House votes aren't necessary for impeachment anyways: <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/fact-check-impeachment.html> <http://archive.is/JOwr7#selection-527.0-556.0> """For example, impeachment inquiries into three federal judges in the 1980s began without explicit authorization by the full House, according to the report. While the whole House voted to start impeachment investigations into Mr. Clinton and Mr. Nixon, whether such a vote was taken in Mr. Johnson’s is more ambiguous. In the second attempt to impeach the 17th president, the full House voted on and approved resolutions authorizing the Committee on Reconstruction to begin a general investigation and to obtain the evidence gathered previously by the Judiciary Committee. But those resolutions did not explicitly authorize a second impeachment inquiry. “There’s no requirement in the Constitution that the House do anything specific, in any order, prior to voting to approve articles of impeachment,” said Stephen Vladek, a constitutional law professor at the University of Texas."""

# procedure: judiciary committee
CLAIM: impeachments inquiries must be conducted by the House Judiciary committee: <https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/10/06/ratcliffe_doj_inspector_generals_report_on_fisa_abuse_during_2016_election_will_be_released_friday.html> """In the 240-plus years of our history, those rare times where we have had impeachment process, it’s always gone through the House Judiciary Committee, because the House Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction over the Constitution and over impeachment. It’s not the Intelligence Committee."""
REALITY: impeachment inquiries need not be conducted by the House Judiciary committee -- indeed, several impeachments predate the House Judiciary committee: <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/fact-check-impeachment.html> <http://archive.is/JOwr7#selection-443.85-471.1> But while impeachment inquiries have been typically conducted by the House Judiciary Committee since its formation in 1813, there is no rule mandating it and there is precedent for other committees taking the lead. Special committees began impeachment inquiries against federal judges in 1804, 1808 and 1839. And in 1867, after the Judiciary Committee voted to not send articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson to the full House, a second attempt to impeach him succeeded after an inquiry by the Committee on Reconstruction.

# procedure: trial rights
CLAIM: the impeachment inquiry was invalid because the President wasn't able to cross-examine witnesses, call witnesses, and otherwise defend himself, as in a trial: <https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-Letter-10.08.2019.pdf> """Yet the Committees have decided to deny the President these elementary rights and protections that form the basis of the American justice system and are protected by the Constitution. No citizen - including the President - should be treated this unfairly.""""""To comply with the Constitution's demands, appropriate procedures would include-at a minimum-the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony.

The House Judiciary Committee did hear testimony from the White House counsel at the request of the Clinton administration in 1998 and allowed Mr. Nixon’s defense lawyers to present rebutting evidence in 1974.

Thus, the true civilian fatality rate since 2004 according to our analysis is approximately 32 percent. Averaging the press reports in 2009 indicates that 502 people were killed, 382 of whom were described as militants, for an average civilian fatality rate of 24 percent.

drone strikes in Pakistan have a positive correlation with terrorism within a week and a negative correlation with terrorism after the first week: <https://academic.oup.com/cesifo/article/64/4/667/4996288> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/cesifo/ify011> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635326283735367690/ify011f1.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1169784975382564984/image.png """We find that there is little significant impact of drone strikes on Taliban attacks in Afghanistan but that there is a significant impact of drone strikes on Taliban attacks in Pakistan. This impact varies from a positive vengeance effect in the first week following a drone strike to a negative deterrent/incapacitation effect in the second week following a drone strike, when we examine the incidence of terrorist attacks by the Taliban.""""""We find that a terrorist attack in Pakistan is 17.7% less likely to occur 3 days after a successful drone strike. At the same time we find that a terrorist attack is 9.7 and 7.5% more likely to occur five and 6 days after an unsuccessful drone strike, and that a terrorist attack is 7.5 and 8.7% less likely to occur 12 and 13 days after an unsuccessful drone strike. There are 0.283 fewer terrorist attacks in Pakistan 15 days after a successful drone strike, 0.099 more terrorist attacks in Pakistan 6 days after an unsuccessful drone strike, and 0.121 fewer terrorist attacks in Pakistan 12 days after an unsuccessful drone strike (all else constant). These effects are statistically significant. Because all of the statistically significant coefficients on successful drone strikes are negative, it appears that there is an incapacitation effect of the Taliban due to a lost militant leader."""

RNC Chairman Michael Steele: <https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/how-trump-remixed-the-republican-southern-strategy/495719/> """For the last 40-plus years we had a "Southern strategy" that alienated many minority voters by focusing on the white male vote in the South.

Nixon political strategist Kevin Phillips: <http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/phillips-southern.pdf> """From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that... but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats."""
Reagan and Bush I strategist Lee Atwater: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater> """You start out in 1954 by saying, "N****r, n****r, n****r." By 1968 you can't say "n****r" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "n****r, n****r.""""

# nondemocratic: sham 2014 presidential
the 2014 Syrian election results summaries were accurate *to the voter*, suggesting the results were arrived at first, then the number of voters who voted for each candidate: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Syrian_presidential_election> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/633316768634503171/unknown.png Andrew Gelman suggested that the results could be fabricated based on the unlikely accurate numbers.[48] For example, 10,319,723/11,634,412 = 0.886999962, so the 88.7% number for Bashar al-Assad is correct to the nearest single voter. Similarly, the proportion for NIACS comes out at 0.042999938 and for the Independent party at 0.031999985. But whilst Gelman's argument provides evidence that the published counts were fabricated, he admits that it does not preclude the theory that those numbers could have been generated retrospectively (and unprofessionally) from valid percentages. The proportion reported for turnout, 0.734237287, does not exhibit the unusual property found in the vote counts.

# war crimes: confirmed and unconfirmed chemical attacks
* TLDR: Confirmed: 2013 Khan al-Assal (Syrian government), 2013 Ghouta (Syrian government)
Syrian government: 19 March 2013 Khan al-Assal: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (numerous eyewitness reports) but could not obtain environmental or blood samples and could not evaluate munitions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_al-Assal_chemical_attack> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> Due to the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit to Khan Al Asal and therefore was not in a position to collect primary evidence relating to the number or type of munitions and/or delivery system that was used in the incident. [....] Due to the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit to Khan Al Asal and therefore was not in a position to collect environmental samples. In addition, six months following the incident, the probative value of such samples would be negligible. The Russian Federation presented the United Nations Mission with its own report relying on environmental samples collected by a Russian investigation team, which found remainders of Sarin. The United Nations Mission studied the report but could not independently verify the chain of custody for the sampling and the transport of the samples. [....] The United Nations Mission applied the standards for epidemiologic determination of cause-and-effect and assessed that an organophosphorous intoxication was the cause of the rapidly onsetting mass intoxication taking place on the morning of the 19 March 2013. Based on its interviews and the assessment of the medical records obtained from five hospitals receiving the alleged victims, the United Nations Mission did not determine any alternative explanations for the symptoms.
Unknown: 13 April 2013 Sheikh Maqsood: UN could not obtain environmental or blood samples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War_(January%E2%80%93April_2013)#13_April> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission sought to conduct fact-finding activities pertaining to this incident from the territory of a bordering country, having determined that such an investigation held the prospect of producing additional information. The United Nations Mission was ultimately unable to obtain any such information.
Unknown: 29 April 2013 Saraqueb: UN could not obtain environmental or blood samples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraqib_chemical_attack> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit and therefore was not able to collect any environmental samples. The French Government presented a report containing results of environmental samples testing positive for Sarin. The United Nations Mission studied the report but could not independently verify the chain of custody for the sampling and the transport of the samples.
Syrian government: 21 August 2013 Ghouta: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (environmental samples 2x, blood samples, eyewitness reports) from surface-to-surface rockets with sufficient quality that the perpetrator must have had access to the Syrian military's chemical weapons stockpile: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack> <https://undocs.org/A/67/997> [O]n 21 August 2013, chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale. In particular, the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent Sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus. [....] Close to the rocket impact sites, in the area where patients were affected, the environment was found to be contaminated by Sarin. <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The final laboratory results on environmental samples from Ghouta (Moadamiyah and Zamalka) are published below (see table 5.1). The results further support the conclusion of the earlier report (A/67/997-S/2013/553), improving the consistency between the results of the two laboratories. <https://www.refworld.org/docid/53182eed4.html> The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents. Concerning the incident in Khan Al-Assal on 19 March, the chemical agents used in that attack bore the same unique hallmarks as those used in Al-Ghouta.
Not chemical weapons: 22 August 2013 Bahhariyeh: UN found sufficient evidence against chemical weapon use (blood samples): <https://undocs.org/A/67/997> The United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit and was therefore not able to collect any environmental samples. [....] Blood and urine samples were collected from the most severely intoxicated patients. The analysis results tested negative for any of the chemical warfare agents.
Unknown: 24 August 2013 Jobar: <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (blood samples x2, eyewitness reports) but could not evaluate munitions: While the United Nations Mission visited the site, it found the site to have been corrupted by mine-clearing activities. As such, there was no probative value in collecting samples. The Syrian Government allegedly recovered soil samples from the impact site that tested positive for Sarin. The United Nations Mission could not verify the chain of custody for this sampling and subsequent analysis. [....] The United Nations Mission was given four samples reportedly withdrawn by the Syrian Government on 24 August 2013 upon the victims’ arrival to the hospital, which were all positive for Sarin exposure. The United Nations Mission collected four blood samples on 28 September 2013, one of which tested positive for Sarin exposure. All samples were subjected to DNA testing to confirm the origin of the presented whole blood samples. The analyses confirmed that the four samples provided by the Syrian Government matched those of the four alleged victims interviewed and sampled. The medical records received from Martyr Yusuf Al Azmah Military Hospital provided corroborating evidence of cholinesterase inhibition indicating Sarin exposure in two of the four patients.
Unknown: 25 August 2013 Ashrafiah Sahnaya: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (blood samples x2) but could not evaluate munitions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission did not visit the site of the alleged incident and was therefore not in a position to collect primary information concerning the munitions. According to witnesses, a catapult allegedly threw unidentified objects aiming at the military checkpoint. [....] The United Nations Mission did not visit the site of the alleged incident and was therefore not in a position to collect environmental samples. [....] On 29 September 2013, the United Nations Mission was given five samples allegedly drawn by the Syrian Government on 25 August 2013 upon the arrival of the patients at the hospital. The United Nations Mission drew its own blood samples on 26 and 28 September 2013. 107. All samples were subjected to DNA testing to confirm the origin of the presented whole blood samples. The analyses confirmed that the samples provided by the Syrian Government matched those of the alleged victims interviewed and sampled. The five blood samples drawn on 25 August 2013 all tested positive for Sarin exposure, whereas those drawn on 26 and 28 September tested negative.

UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria 2017: claims of ethnic cleansing by Rojava / DFNS are false, but displaced people face significant hunger, thirst, and homelessness: <http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/14032017> """The Commission notes in its report that mass numbers of people were displaced during SDF offensives to oust ISIS from Manbij city in the summer of 2016 and Tishreen Dam in December 2015 and that some continue to remain unable to return to their homes, “living under dire humanitarian conditions.” However, “the presence of concealed bombs laid by ISIL justifies ordering the temporary displacement of civilians,” the Commission stated, using an alternate acronym for ISIS. While the displacement was justified, the Commission noted that the SDF and YPG failed to provide adequate assistance to the displaced families in the form of basics like shelter, food, and health care."""
from 2014-2017, the most that Amnesty International could allege against Rojava (a state of 6 million in a 4-year war against ISIS, Syria, and Turkey) are: one forced population movement, one unjustified bulldozing of a village, several unjustified arrests of journalists, and incomplete due process in the courts: <https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/syria/report-syria/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/6381/2017/en/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/6871/2017/en/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/09/syria-abuses-mar-pyd-fight-against-terrorism/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/2503/2015/en/> <https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2014/11/life-and-death-in-no-man-s-land-between-syria-and-turkey/>

And many more blame either the Taliban or al Qaeda for the country’s violence, 53 percent, than blame the United States, 12 percent. The latter is about half what it was in 2012, coinciding with a sharp reduction in the U.S. deployment. [....] The Taliban are vastly unpopular; just 4 percent prefer the group to the current government. Yet tolerance, while still comparatively slight, has risen; 21 percent now say they support the presence of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, double the number who said so in 2010. And still more, 31 percent, say they support the presence of foreign jihadi fighters, up by 14 points in the same time period. [....] Also comparing to 2010, perceived security from the Taliban and other armed groups is up by 15 points; while the reasons aren’t entirely clear, this may reflect a changed dynamic as ISAF forces have withdrawn and the Taliban have consolidated their hold on some areas. Indeed, reported security from the Taliban has increased especially sharply in some of the areas where they’ve gained greater control, the East and South Central regions. Those results compare with a much broader 77 percent support for the presence of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, also up from 2010, by 15 points. Taken together, the trend lines indicate that, perhaps understandably, some Afghans’ priority may not be whose flag flies over their village, but the extent of security they feel."""

# premature babies ripped from incubators: Nayirah testimony fraud
timeline and background: the "Nayirah testimony" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony>
1990 October 9: George Bush repeated the claim, originally pushed by a bevy of pro-Kuwait sources, that babies had been ripped from incubators: <https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-21> <https://archive.vn/wip/JA483> """And I am very much concerned, not just about the physical dismantling but of the brutality that has now been written on by Amnesty International confirming some of the tales told us by the Amir of brutality. It's just unbelievable, some of the things at least he reflected. I mean, people on a dialysis machine cut off, the machine sent to Baghdad; babies in incubators heaved out of the incubators and the incubators themselves sent to Baghdad. Now, I don't know how many of these tales can be authenticated, but I do know that when the Amir was here he was speaking from the heart. And after that came Amnesty International, who were debriefing many of the people at the border. And it's sickening."""
1990 October 10: a 15yo girl identified as Nayirah, now known to be Nayirah Al-Sabah, daughter of Saud Al-Sabah (the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States), spoke to Congress and claimed to be a nurse who had seen Iraqi soldiers had ripped babies from incubators: <https://www.c-span.org/video/?14441-1/human-rights-violations-kuwait> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnREW2OqFKI> """I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns, and go into the room where 15 babies were in incubators. They took the babies out of the incubators, took the incubators and left the babies on the cold floor to die."""
Following the liberation of Kuwait, reporters were given access to the country. An ABC report found that "patients, including premature babies, did die, when many of Kuwait's nurses and doctors ... fled" but Iraqi troops "almost certainly had not stolen hospital incubators and left hundreds of Kuwaiti babies to die."

# Amnesty International's role in supporting the babies in incubators story
summary: Amnesty International initially corroborated Nayirah's story in 1990 and provided testimony from evacuees on the supposed killings that suggested an even *greater* number of babies killed. It wasn't until January 1991 that the organization expressed revulsion at the use of their work to support the war.
19 December 1990: Amnesty International published a report claiming that not just 15 but "300 premature babies" died "after Iraqi soldiers removed them from incubators, which were then looted": <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/016/1990/en/> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791830983233896448/1052512863585054740/MDE140161990ENGLISH.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/791830983233896448/1052512956816031744/image.png
Although this testimony was a great shock to the American people, it did not succeed in convincing them of the need to intervene in Iraq. The turning point for public opinion was the 82-page report that Amnesty International issued on December 19, 1990. In the report, the human rights watchdog not only confirmed Nayirah’s testimony, but claimed that Iraqi soldiers took 312 Kuwaiti infants out of their incubators and killed them.
^ skeptical coverage of the above report, in 2003, by Democracy Now's Amy Goodman: <https://www.democracynow.org/2003/12/2/a_debate_on_one_of_the> """On December 19, 1990, Amnesty International published an 84-page report on human rights violations in occupied Kuwait. The report stated that, “300 premature babies were reported to have died after Iraqi soldiers removed them from incubators, which were then looted.” This allegation, which was widely reported by the global media, became one of the most often cited justifications for the 1991 Gulf War. On January 9 1991, President George HW Bush cited Amnesty’s report in a letter sent to campus newspapers across the country. In the Senate, six senators specifically cited the story in their speeches supporting the resolution to give Bush authorization to use American forces in Kuwait. That vote ultimately passed by a mere half-dozen votes."""
28 January 1991: Amnesty International's executive director John Healey emphasized that their reports before Iraq invaded Kuwait were ignored, and accused George HW Bush's administration of "opportunistic manipulation of the international human rights movement" by using Amnesty's report in his letter justifying the invasion: <https://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&d=bcheights19910128.2.41&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------> <https://archive.vn/B0zLH> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1052428114136928378/image.png *The Heights*,  "Amnesty responds to President Bush", """Clear facts. Black and white. Unambiguous choice. These are the terms President Bush used in the letter he sent to over 450 college and university newspapers last week. The subject was Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The objective was to prepare young people for military confrontation in thePersian Gulf. The letter cited Amnesty International's recent report on Iraq as evidence to support the administration's position. Perhaps presidential advisers know that Amnesty volunteer groups are now active on more than 2,600 campuses in this country. I hope the administration will soon learn that Amnesty members and other student activists cannot be misled by opportunistic manipulation of the international human rights movement. Amnesty published its report on the Iraqi Government's gross human rights violations for one purpose: to advance the protection of human rights."""
Regan 2002: <https://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0906/p25s02-cogn.html> """It's wasn't an easy sell. After all, Kuwait was hardly a "freedom-loving land." Only a few weeks before the invasion, Amnesty International accused the Kuwaiti government of jailing dozens of dissidents and torturing them without trial. In an effort to spruce up the Kuwait image, the company organized Kuwait Information Day on 20 college campuses, a national day of prayer for Kuwait, distributed thousands of "Free Kuwait" bumper stickers, and other similar traditional PR ventures. But none of it was working very well. American public support remained lukewarm the first two months."""

# no Iraqi army buildup on Saudi border: satellite photos disprove
1990 September 11: George HW Bush, speaking to Congress, claimed that Iraq poured >100,000 troops and >800 tanks into Kuwait, then threatened the Saudi Arabia border: <https://bush41library.tamu.edu/archives/public-papers/2217> <https://archive.vn/nR8DF> """We gather tonight, witness to events in the Persian Gulf as significant as they are tragic.

In the middle of the airfield are what could be camouflaged staging areas. "We didn't find anything of that sort anywhere in Kuwait. We don't see any tent cities, we don't see congregations of tanks, we don't see troop concentrations, and the main Kuwaiti air base appears deserted.

# 9/11 and the axis of evil
George Bush, 29 January 2002, includes Iraq in the axis of evil that will export terror like 9/11: <https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-22> **Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know their true nature.** North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens. Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. **Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.** States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
George Bush, 07 October 2002, alleges Iraq could harbor Al-Qaeda in the future: <https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html> We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary; confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.

This resolution did not pass.[165][166] Ultimately, a resolution of disapproval was brought to the Senate floor, but failed. A resolution of approval was brought to the House floor, but it, too, failed. As a result, the agreement went into effect following congressional review period.[167]

The images of Yablonska Street show at least 11 "dark objects of similar size to a human body" appearing between 9 and 11 March. Their location precisely matches positions where the bodies were filmed by a local council member after Ukrainian forces reclaimed the city. A second video on the same street shows three bodies near bicycles and abandoned cars, which according to satellite imagery appeared between 20 and 21 March. The Times concluded that the analysis rebuts Russian claims about the killing of civilians happening after withdrawal of the Russian army.

# bucha massacre: german intelligence
Der Spiegel, 2022 April 7: the German foreign intelligence service BND intercepted radio traffic from north of Kiev; BND claims the audio incriminates Russian soldiers, who spoke about killing civilians as though it were commonplace; BND claims the audio indicates that the Wagner Group was present: <https://archive.ph/iRL2l> <https://archive.ph/6cGKv> """The intercepted comments now appear to refute Russia’s denials. DER SPIEGEL has learned that the BND briefed parliamentarians on Wednesday about its findings. Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along the main road through town. In one of them, a soldier apparently told another that they had just shot a person on a bicycle. That corresponds to the photo of the dead body lying next to a bicycle that has been shared around the world. In another intercepted conversation, a man apparently said: First you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them. The BND material also apparently provides evidence that members of the Russian mercenary unit called the Wagner Group played a leading role in the atrocities. The group is known to have perpetrated similar atrocities in Syria. [....] The radio traffic intercepted by the BND makes it seem as though the atrocities perpetrated on civilians in Bucha were neither random acts nor the product of individual soldiers who got out of hand. Rather, say sources familiar with the audio, the material suggests that the troops spoke of the atrocities as though they were simply discussing their everyday lives. That, say sources familiar with the audio, indicates that the murder of civilians has become a standard element of Russian military activity, potentially even part of a broader strategy. The intention is that of spreading fear among the civilian population and thus reducing the will to resist."""

There were military vehicles at every house, near every apartment building. “We saw them [military vehicles] driving down the street [Sklozavodska], shooting randomly at windows,” Olena said. “They were just shooting.” Russian soldiers went from house to house, breaking doors and windows, searching and questioning people. Olena saw them taking people’s clothes and shoes, changing, and dumping their own clothes on the street. They heard reports of extrajudicial killings and civilians shot while trying to get water. [....] The soldiers walked Olena back to Yablunska Street and told her to stand facing away from her house.

And then [shelling] hit the house, two direct hits, one after another. We all fell to the floor. Two or three minutes later we heard glass breaking outside, then loud steps. Someone was yelling: “Check the second floor!” Vitya moved, he got up, there was automatic gunfire and he fell, screaming in pain. He yelled: “Please don’t shoot! I am wounded, there are civilians here, children, don’t shoot.” “The [soldiers] started banging on the door. We opened and they walked in. There were 4 or 5 of them, I don’t even remember now. Their clothes were very dirty, some of them had St. George [orange and black striped] ribbons on their helmets. They told us to get outside, one by one. We went into the yard. We said, there is a wounded man there, please help him. They refused. They said they had no bandages or medicines. We stood there for 30 or 40 minutes while they searched the house. Then they came outside, told us to go in and stay there, and left. We went inside. We tried to help Vitya. He was still alive, lying where we left him. “We cut his sweater open and saw that there was a surface wound on this chest, no entry bullet wound, and I thought for a moment that it was not so bad. But when we turned him over, we saw three bullet holes around his left shoulder blade. His sleeve was soaked through, and the blood pooled on the floor under him. We tried to stop the bleeding with the bedsheet. He was struggling to breathe.” Viktor died 20 minutes later. Dmytro and his family put him on a mattress and dragged him to the boiler room, which was the coldest room in the house. They spent two more nights sheltering in Viktor and Olena’s house before fleeing Bucha. Dmytro’s voice was calm but it shook a little when he said he felt responsible for what happened. “If I hadn’t asked them for help, Vitya might have still been alive.”"""

There were around 30 military there and the commander had [paratrooper] insignia [on his fatigues]. He spoke with an accent from western or central western Russia…. I was born in Russia myself, so I pick up on such things. The soldiers were all thin and looked the worse for wear. She said that the soldiers brought about 40 people to the square, gathered everyone’s phones, checked documents, and asked who was in territorial defense, or local self-defense units: Two women asked to go to the bathroom. One of them was pregnant. I asked to go with them. A soldier showed us the way to the toilet, which was around the building, I think it was now their headquarters. The building was long. Along the wall on the other side, we saw a large pool of blood. She said they waited in the square for hours in the very cold weather: At one point they brought in one young man, then four more. The soldiers ordered them [to] take off their boots and jackets. They made them kneel on the side of the road. Russian soldiers pulled their T-shirts, from behind and over their heads. They shot one in the back of the head. He fell. Women screamed. The other four men were just kneeling there. The commander said to the rest of the people at the square: “Don’t worry. You are all normal – and this is dirt. We are here to cleanse you from the dirt.” She said that after several more hours the soldiers took the people back to their homes.

# glory to ukraine / slava ukraini: far-right slogan or ukrainian nationalist slogan
#####o
# history
Likhachev 2022: from 2000 to 2012 (pre-Maidan), "Glory to Ukraine" went from a slogan of rightist hooligans to a slogan occasionally used by more mainstream groups: <http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1640388&dswid=5492> <http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1640388&dswid=5492> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1061135138144145508/Likhachev2022.pdf> """When young people from such groups went to public actions, they always chanted “Glory to Ukraine – glory to the heroes!” as well. This slogan was a historic OUN greeting. It was widely used, however, not only by street radicals, but also by the more respectable politicians of the national democratic camp. In particular, Viktor Yushchenko, the president who made the patriotic politics of national memory a priority during his cadency in 2005–2010, used this phrase. The National Democrats turned to the symbolic language of the fghters for Ukrainian independence in the middle of the 20th century in an efort to emphasize the historical continuity of the national movement. The legacy of the OUN was perceived uncritically in this environment. In Viktor Yushchenko’s time, the episodes of cooperation between the leadership of various groups of the OUN and Nazi Germany were ignored or justifed in ofcial memory policy . The scale of ethnic cleansing against Poles by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), a militarist structure created by the Ukrainian underground during the war, was understated. Special attention was paid to the armed struggle between the UPA and the Soviet regime, which was undeniably courageous and truly unique in scale and duration. Viktor Yushchenko, by his decrees, conferred the title of Hero of Ukraine on Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych (commander of the UPA). Under the next president, Viktor Yanukovych, the court ruled that these decrees were illegal. If the slogan “Glory to Ukraine!” was common to the entire Ukrainian national-patriotic spectrum, from moderate national liberals to street extremists, other formulations marked a specifcally ultra-right segment. These included “Glory to the nation – death to the enemies!” and “Ukraine is above all!”"""
Likhachev 2022: during Maidan (2013-2014), "Glory to Ukraine" went from a slogan of mostly rightists to a more general slogan, nearly ubiquitous: <http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1640388&dswid=5492> <http://sh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1640388&dswid=5492> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1061135138144145508/Likhachev2022.pdf> """During three months of continuous public actions on the Maidan at the turn of 2013 – 2014, the symbolic line, previously exclusively owned by the far right, became part of the common language of protests. The national radicals themselves constituted an insignifcant minority in the total mass of the Maidan participants, and they did not have a signifcant impact on the protests in general.7 But in a situation of forceful confrontation, frst with police special forces and “titushki”,8 then with representatives of pro-Russian groups, Euromaidan activists naturally turned to the symbolic tradition that had formed in the era of armed struggle. That was the tradition of the nationalist language. The slogan “Glory to Ukraine – glory to the heroes!” became widespread on the Maidan. Almost all public speeches began and ended with these words, people greeted and said goodbye by using this slogan, etc. Slogans “Glory to the nation!” and “Ukraine above all” went beyond the narrow national-radical segment of the protesters as well. Apart from the national radical tradition, there was simply no other developed and well-established speech culture that was appropriate in this situation. True, even the Maidan taught Ukrainians the tradition of collective performance of the national anthem. Previously, it was rarely performed spontaneously, even at political events."""

But McCain’s actions were a model of diplomatic restraint compared to the conduct of Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs. As Ukraine’s political crisis deepened, Nuland and her subordinates became more brazen in favoring the anti‐​Yanukovych demonstrators. Nuland noted in a speech to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation on December 13, 2013, that she had traveled to Ukraine three times in the weeks following the start of the demonstrations. Visiting the Maidan on December 5, she handed out cookies to demonstrators and expressed support for their cause.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957

The extent of the Obama administration’s meddling in Ukraine’s politics was breathtaking. Russian intelligence intercepted and leaked to the international media a Nuland telephone call in which she and U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Geoffey Pyatt discussed in detail their preferences for specific personnel in a post‐​Yanukovych government. The U.S‑favored candidates included Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the man who became prime minister once Yanukovych was ousted from power. During the telephone call, Nuland stated enthusiastically that “Yats is the guy” who would do the best job.

The two diplomats also were prepared to escalate the already extensive U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s political turbulence. Pyatt stated bluntly that “we want to try to get somebody with an international personality to come out here and help to midwife this thing [the political transition].” Nuland clearly had Vice President Joe Biden in mind for that role. Noting that the vice president’s national security adviser was in direct contact with her, Nuland related that she told him “probably tomorrow for an atta‐​boy and to get the details to stick. So Biden’s willing.”

# neo-nazism in the azov battalion
the Azov Battalion's publishing outfit Plomin is openly promoting neo-Nazi writings, such as Freda's "Disintegration of the System", which writes that "We have nothing to see with the mercantile Europe, with the Europe of plutocratic colonialism: nothing to share. We only have accounts to settle with the Jewish or Judaized Europe": <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/01/22/ukraines-far-right-is-boosting-a-pro-putin-fascist/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935774510890766376/unknown.png
the Russian far-right generally opposes Putin for moderation on issues like immigration; some supported Ukraine in the Donbas War: <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/09/04/the-hardcore-russian-neo-nazi-group-that-calls-ukraine-home/> """Many Russian far-right nationalists have, perhaps to the surprise of many, been anti-Kremlin and opposed Putin’s rule due to their perception of his soft stance on issues like immigration, best seen in the annual “Russian March”. While a large portion of the Russian far-right was instrumental in fomenting and fighting in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine, some factions of the Russian far-right actually supported the protests on Maidan Nezalezhnosti in Kyiv that mushroomed into the February 2014 revolution and have found room to operate within Ukraine. This included two of Wotanjugend’s leaders, Ivan Mikheev and Alexey Levkin. As Russian and Russian-led forces — including a sizable presence of Russian far-right nationalists, namely through the influence of Konstantin Malofeev and Eduard Limonov — began war in the Donbas in April 2014, some Wotanjugend members were among Russian far-right nationalists who came to Ukraine to fight with far-right pro-Ukrainian forces, including the Azov Battalion. Mikheev and Levkin, along with other Russian neo-Nazis like Roman Zheleznov, came to Ukraine in late 2014; Levkin and others remain in Ukraine five years later."""

# ukrainian government promotions of far-right: frequent
Bellingcat 2019: in 2019, Ukrainian Prime Minister Honcharuk promoted the "Veterans Strong" concert and spoke at it, organized by S14 member Andriy Medvedko, headlined by neo-Nazi band Sokyra Peruna: <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/10/21/how-to-mainstream-neo-nazis-a-lesson-from-ukraines-new-government/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935790553835143218/unknown.png
Bellingcat 2019: in 2019, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy invited Azov Battalion leaders and spoke of them as "veterans" in discussing peace talks in the region: <https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2019/10/21/how-to-mainstream-neo-nazis-a-lesson-from-ukraines-new-government/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935791041473314826/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/935784583222419526/unknown.png """Another example of this trend was on display in early October at a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, when members of the far-right (including C14 leader Yevhen Karas) were invited to offer their perspective on the war in eastern Ukraine. Azov was also present, being the largest far-right group in Ukraine that also has a regiment in Ukraine’s National Guard. “Yesterday I met with veterans,” Zelenskyy said in early October, “National Corps [the Azov movement’s political party], Azov, everyone else.” A photo from the meeting shows multiple far-right figures in attendance, including C14’s Yevhen Karas and Dmytro Shatrovskyi, head of the Azov-linked “Veterans Brotherhood.” [....] However, why does Zelenskyy meet with multiple representatives of far-right groups — and, moreover, speak of them simply as “veterans,” discounting the vast majority of Ukraine’s veterans who have no involvement in extremist organizations? Why are there multiple members of far-right groups, including people who are openly neo-Nazi, on Ukraine’s Ministry of Veterans Affairs public oversight council? Despite the fact that these far-right organizations have negligible popular support and virtually nonexistent electoral power, they are over-represented among veterans’ rights groups, including in meetings directly with Ukraine’s President. As the veterans’ concert shows, these issues are symptoms of a much larger problem relating to the far-right’s exploitation of veterans’ issues as they continue to have success mainstreaming themselves in Ukrainian politics and society."""

* PIS is Poland's conservative party:
PIS is seizing control of the state media: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/poland-president-signs-bill-putting-state-media-under-government-control>: Poland’s president has signed into law a bill handing the conservative government control of state media, despite concern elsewhere in the EU and condemnation from rights watchdogs. [....] Under the new law, senior figures in public radio and television will be appointed – and sacked – by the treasury minister, and will no longer be hired by the National Broadcasting Council. Under the legislation current managers and supervisory board members of Poland’s public broadcasters will be fired with immediate effect.
PIS is seizing control of the independent judiciary: <https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-20/poland-steps-away-democracy-and-eu-latest-judiciary-reforms>: Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, which is controlled by the ruling far-right Law and Justice Party (PiS), have passed a bill that would force 83 of the nation’s top judges to resign and will give the governing party control over who replaces them. In Poland, the Supreme Court is not only the final court of appeal for all criminal and civil cases, but also the body that rules on the validity of elections — which is exactly what concerns the EU and political opponents.
PIS is trying to ban *all* abortions, even for safety: <https://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/poland-black-protests-womens-strike-abortion-pis>: It wasn’t until 2016, when the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, introduced a bill that would have made abortion completely illegal that the women’s movement was able to break out of this isolation. Abortion is legal in Poland only in three cases: when pregnancy is the result of rape, when the fetus shows risks of severe damage or illness, and when the life of the woman is endangered. Unfortunately, even under these conditions women often do not obtain permission to terminate pregnancies, which leads them either to illegal abortions, in Poland or abroad, or to face serious risks to give birth anyways. Official statistics count only around 100 legal abortions per year in Poland; but, according to feminist organizations, some 140,000 illegal ones are additionally carried out. The PiS bill would have made abortion illegal even in these exceptional cases. Additionally, it would have criminalized not only women who sought abortions, but their doctors and anyone else who assisted them, allowing them to be sentenced to up to two years of jail time.
PIS is trying to criminalize discussion of Poland's part in the Holocaust: <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/poland-antisemitism-nationalism-holocaust>: Under the guise of defending the good name of “The Polish Nation” the bill opens the way to criminalising anyone who seeks to reveal dark chapters of Polish history, such as antisemitic pogroms before, during and after the war. But this is a veneer. What is truly at stake is not Poland’s reputation, but Polish nationalist rightwing tradition. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) makes no secret of the fact that it is part of this tradition. The language and ideas of PiS leaders, as well as their policies towards refugees, minorities and political opposition, draw directly from the rhetoric and strategy of Polish nationalism in the first half of the 20th century. [It's already been used for this purpose: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/polish-group-files-suit-against-argentina-newspaper-over-holocaust-story> ]
PIS supported thousands of far-right marchers with racist slogans under falangist banners: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/12/white-europe-60000-nationalists-march-on-polands-independence-day: Tens of thousands of nationalist demonstrators marched through Warsaw at the weekend to mark Poland’s independence day, throwing red-smoke bombs and carrying banners with slogans such as “white Europe of brotherly nations”. Police estimated 60,000 people took part in Saturday’s event, in what experts say was one of the biggest gathering of far-right activists in Europe in recent years. Demonstrators with faces covered chanted “Pure Poland, white Poland!” and “Refugees get out!” [....] TVP, which reflects the conservative government’s line, called it a “great march of patriots”, and in its broadcasts described the event as one that drew mostly ordinary Poles expressing their love of Poland, not extremists.

# definition of apartheid
The Apartheid Convention defines the crime against humanity of apartheid as “inhuman acts committed for the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them.” The Rome Statute of the ICC adopts a similar definition: “inhumane acts… committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.” The Rome Statute does not further define what constitutes an “institutionalized regime.”
The crime of apartheid under the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute consists of three primary elements: an intent to maintain a system of domination by one racial group over another; systematic oppression by one racial group over another; and one or more inhumane acts, as defined, carried out on a widespread or systematic basis pursuant to those policies.
Among the inhumane acts identified in either the Convention or the Rome Statute are “forcible transfer,” “expropriation of landed property,” “creation of separate reserves and ghettos,” and denial of the “the right to leave and to return to their country, [and] the right to a nationality.”

# definition of persecution
The Rome Statute identifies the crime against humanity of persecution as “the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity,” including on racial, national, or ethnic grounds. Customary international law identifies the crime of persecution as consisting of two primary elements: (1) severe abuses of fundamental rights committed on a widespread or systematic basis, and (2) with discriminatory intent.

Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’” 4 So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. 5 Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. 6 Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites. 7 Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. 8 He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. 9 But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves[b] and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed."""

Israeli Ministry of Intelligence, which is roughly similar to the Director of National Intelligence in the United States, had documents leaked by Mekomit [Local Call]: <https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%a1%d7%9e%d7%9a-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%9c%d7%90-%d7%a9%d7%9c-%d7%9e%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%93-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%95%d7%93%d7%99%d7%a2%d7%99%d7%9f-%d7%9b%d7%99%d7%91%d7%95%d7%a9-%d7%a2%d7%96%d7%94-%d7%95/> 
Israeli Ministry of Information 2023: outlined three options: Option A, to restore the sovereignty of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza; rejected as an "an unprecedented victory of the Palestinian national movement"; Option B, to create a new local governance of Gaza; rejected because it could "lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state"; and Option C, to expel the population of Gaza permanently into Sinai and various countries; described as the preferred option which will ""will yield positive, long-term strategic outcomes for Israel": <https://www.scribd.com/document/681086738/Israeli-Intelligence-Ministry-Policy-Paper-on-Gaza-s-Civilian-Population-October-2023> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1169440409471164416/IMI2023_English.pdf?ex=65556940&is=6542f440&hm=6e73ac3da7808e382f13712a4039c628f840c0d50bed17936e009924658c56ef&>  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1169441130560102420/image.png?ex=655569ec&is=6542f4ec&hm=eeb413eb3964605cb6e63e41fa746dcd02c94584c4adeed5b36991f49d441971& """5. The three options under examination are: a. Option A: The population remaining in Gaza and the import of Palestinian Authority (PA) rule. b. Option B: The population remaining in Gaza along with the emergence of a local Arab authority. c. Option C: The evacuation of the civilian population from Gaza to Sinai. 6. From an in-depth look at the options, the following insights can be derived: a. Option C - The option that will yield positive, long-term strategic outcomes for Israel, and is an executable option. It requires determination from the political echelon in the face of international pressure, with an emphasis on harnessing the support of the United States and additional pro-Israeli countries for the endeavor. b. Options A and B suffer from significant deficiencies, especially in terms of their strategic implications and the lack of long-term feasibility. Neither of them will provide the necessary deterrent effect, will not allow for a mindset shift, and may lead within a few years to the same issues and threats that Israel has been dealing with from 2007 until today. c. Option A is the option with the most risks; the division between the Palestinian population in Judea and Samaria (West Bank) and Gaza is one of the central obstacles preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state. Choosing this option entails an unprecedented victory for the Palestinian national movement, a victory that will come at the cost of thousands of Israeli civilians and soldiers and does not guarantee security for Israel."""

# But weren't the Nazis the National **Socialist** German **Workers'** Party?
Yes. However, as he stated in this 1938 speech, Hitler was **explicitly** not a socialist in the "economically left and socially left" sense ( <https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ&q=Our+adopted+term+%27Socialist%27+has+nothing+to+do+with+Marxian+Socialism.+Marxism+is+anti-property;+true+Socialism+is+not> ): """'Socialist' I define from the word 'social; meaning in the main ‘social equity’. A Socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his personal efficiency. **Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.** Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false."""

# But weren't the Nazis the National **Socialist** German **Workers'** Party?
Yes. However, as he stated in this 1935 speech, Hitler saw many differences between his ideology and the USSR's: <https://books.google.com/books?id=r_-htwAACAAJ&dq=hitler+may+21+1935+speech> """National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission.""""""National Socialism fights for the reconciliation and consequent adjustment of the differences in life and the union of all for common benefits. Bolshevism teaches the overcoming of an alleged class rule by the dictatorship of the power of a different class.""""""As National Socialists, our hearts are full with admiration and respect for the great achievements of the past, not only in our own people but also far beyond. We are happy to belong to an European cultural community that has so tremendously embossed today's world with a stamp of its mind.

But we never want a lack of belief in religion or any faith, and do not wish that our churches become club-houses or cinemas. Bolshevism teaches the godlessness and acts accordingly.""""""We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility."""

# But didn't the Nazis and the socialists both use red?
The Nazi flag colors (black, white, red) come from the imperial German flag colors (black, white, red). For example, the nationalist imperial German propaganda song "Stolz weht die Flagge schwarz-weiß-rot" (The Flag Proudly Waves Black-White-Red) <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolz_weht_die_Flagge_schwarz-wei%C3%9F-rot> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIs3S6ckTmw> was explicitly mirrored in Nazi propaganda song "Deutschland du Land der Treue" in the lines "Hakenkreuzfahnen schwarz, weiss, und rot" (Swastika flags black, white, and red) <http://soldatenlieder.blogspot.com/2012/03/deutschland-du-land-der-treue-heil.html> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cvvFm2Vi6M>. Moreover, the use of red in Nazi propaganda was an intentional anti-left tactic, as Hitler stated in Mein Kampf, 1922, Book 2 Vol 2 p. 270: <http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv2ch07.html> "We chose red for our posters after particular and careful deliberation, our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come to our meetings -- if only in order to break them up -- so that in this way we got a chance of talking to the people."

# national socialist people's welfare
because the Nazis consolidated local and state programs, they did increase the federal German budget for social spending: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_People%27s_Welfare> In three budgetary years, the funds required by Germany's social welfare programs had more than doubled from 640.4 million Reichmarks in 1938 to 1.395 billion Reichmarks by 1941.[12]

# fascist italy: capitalist winners, labor losers
italy reduced wages (and utterly failed to replicate FDR's success): <http://www.gustavopiga.it/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PaperGiordanoPigaTrovato_November2011.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/570334413787889677/unknown.png President Roosevelt, as well as raising prices to favor industrialists, also increased workers’ bargaining power and, therefore, their wages. The Fascist government, on the contrary, being more attentive to industrialists’ concerns, on the one hand fought the drop in consumer prices, but on the other, abolished most of the workers’ bargaining power and intervened systematically in cutting wages.

When you're done reading the intro (from the draft version, not the published version), you should read Section III, which explicitly discusses these contrasts, or my quote above, from the conclusion in Section IV.

# But didn't the Nazis seize control of industry?
Yes, but this fact must be contextualized. The Nazis arose during the Great Depression. During this time, **all** Western nations (including the Nazis) used some nationalization and regulation to stablize their economies and later to prepare for war. However, the Nazis **privatized** previously-nationalized industries. (In fact, the term "privatization" was coined to describe Nazi economic policies.)
Bel 2006: <https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.20.3.187> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1257/jep.20.3.187> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1084891636913422427/bel2006.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1084893171630223482/image.png The Coining of “Privatization” and Germany’s National Socialist Party
Bel 2009: while major Western capitalist countries were nationalizing major firms, the Nazis were privatizing them: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00473.x> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2009.00473.x> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1084891235220717628/bel2010.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1084891164869664808/image.png Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany """The Great Depression spurred State ownership in Western capitalist countries. Germany was no exception; the last governments of the Weimar Republic took over firms in diverse sectors. **Later, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in the Western capitalist countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s.** Privatization in Nazi Germany was also unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public services previously provided by government. The firms and the services transferred to private ownership belonged to diverse sectors. **Privatization was part of an intentional policy with multiple objectives and was not ideologically driven.** As in many recent privatizations, particularly within the European Union, strong financial restrictions were a central motivation. In addition, privatization was used as a political tool to enhance support for the government and for the Nazi Party."""

# But didn't the Fascists seize control of industry?
No. In fact, Fascist Italy engaged in the first large-scale privatization in modern Western history: As Germa Bel writes: <http://www.ub.edu/graap/bel_Italy_fascist.pdf> "Italy’s first Fascist government applied a large-scale privatization policy between 1922 and 1925. The government privatized the state monopoly of match sale, eliminated the State monopoly on life insurances, sold most of the State-owned telephone networks and services to private firms, reprivatized the largest metal machinery producer, and awarded concessions to private firms to build and operate motorways. These interventions represent one of the earliest and most decisive privatization episodes in the Western world. While ideological considerations may have had a certain influence, privatization was used mainly as a political tool to build confidence among industrialists and to increase support for the government and the Partito Nazionale Fascista. Privatization also contributed to balancing the budget, which was the core objective of Fascist economic policy in its first phase."

# But didn't the Nazis control industry indirectly and destroy private property?
Yes and no. The Nazis arose during the Great Depression. During this time, **all** Western nations (including the Nazis) used some nationalization and regulation to stablize their economies and later to prepare for war. However, the Nazis believed that private businesses were more efficient than state planning.
Businesses were heavily involved in the Nazis' planning processes: <https://libcom.org/files/Daniel%20Guerin-Fascism%20and%20Big%20Business-Pathfinder%20Press%20(2000).pdf>
Buchheim Scherner 2006: within the limits of Nazi control, firms retained substantial private control (including to reject Reich-requested projects) and pursued profit-seeking as before: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-economic-history/article/abs/role-of-private-property-in-the-nazi-economy-the-case-of-industry/5853885D956348A13B5CEFDC42313E2B> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1017/S0022050706000167> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1085289132869300416/buchheim2006.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1085291310539341975/image.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1085291100505391114/image.png The Role of Private Property in the Nazi Economy: The Case of Industry """Private property in the industry of the Third Reich is often considered a mere nominal provision without much substance. However, that is not correct, because **firms, despite the rationing and licensing activities of the state, still had ample scope to devise their own production and investment profiles.** Even regarding war-related projects, freedom of contract was generally respected; instead of using power, the state offered firms a number of contract options to choose from. **There were several motives behind this attitude of the regime, among them the conviction that private property provided important incentives for increasing efficiency.**"""

# But didn't the Nazis set official wages?
Yes and no. Prior to the Nazis, the Weimar Republic (under socialist influence) created collective wage agreements across industries in hopes of preventing "cut-throat" competition for labor. In contrast, the Nazi official wage rates were far lower than Weimar wage rates, could be overruled (allowing lower pay) for individual companies by the DAF's "labor trustees", and disallowed the possibility of collective bargaining by the workers. <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003232928501400101>

# But didn't the Nazis create the "Labor Front"?
Yes. The Nazis established the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF). To establish the DAF, the Nazis destroyed non-DAF trade unions as "leftist" and seized their funds <https://www.teachers.org.uk/files/trade-unionists-leaflet.pdf>. In name, the DAF was intended to mediate conflicts between businessowners and workers. In practice, the Nazis used the DAF to decrease the worker power and to trap workers in their current place of employment, as William Shirer notes: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT449#v=onepage&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561310446171324425/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561313705271230473/unknown.png

# But didn't the Nazis create "Strength through Joy", Kraft durch Freude?
Yes. KdF was a large vacation program established to sell the working class on Nazism and to boost German tourism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_Through_Joy>; in practice, it was heavily involved in regimenting the leisure time of workers towards Nazi goals rather than allowing them freedom: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT453#v=onepage&q&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561314617423298580/unknown.png

Simon 2021: summary of book: wealthier districts were more likely to vote for Hitler, likely because they bought into the fear campaign against the Communists (and somewhat the Socialists): <https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-hitler-nazi-fascism/> <https://archive.ph/l0zca> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/976592303969931304/unknown.png """In Berlin, “the highest levels of support for the National Socialists came from the upper- and upper-middle-class districts.” Accounting for the Jewish vote and the Catholics who voted for the Center Party, Hitler’s Nazis commanded some 60 percent of the vote in those districts—nearly twice the national average. On the other hand, the lower-middle-class and working-class districts gave Hitler’s party a substantial minority of their votes, somewhere between one-quarter and three-eighths. The trend in Berlin was repeated in Frankfurt, Cologne, Munich, Hanover, Stuttgart, Nuremberg, and Mannheim, with slight variations. Again and again, Hamilton shows below-average support for Hitler in working-class districts, and higher support in upper-middle-class and wealthy ones. There were pockets of rabid support for the Nazis in rural areas. But what we see repeated in chapter after chapter of Who Voted for Hitler? is the disproportionate support for Hitler from the well-heeled districts, motivated by their sense that Hitler would be their weapon against Communism; and because the Nazis had also successfully nurtured a covert anti-Semitism among the upper classes. Working class-neighborhoods were split more evenly, drawn to the Communists or Social Democrats, not strongly anti-Semitic, though susceptible certainly to the Nazi’s organizing exertions."""
Simon 2021: haunting comparison: <https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/trump-hitler-nazi-fascism/> <https://archive.ph/l0zca> """A most impactful provision of the Versailles treaty, it turns out, was to drastically reduce the size of the German military, pushing out hundreds of thousands of young men, “providing these men with one very substantial additional grievance and then injecting them directly into civilian life,” as Hamilton writes. A pithy and breathtaking comparison might be drawn here with the decommissioning of the rebel army at the end of the only other protracted war of the prior century, which was America’s Civil War, and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and other vigilante groups that followed it."""
Challenging the traditional belief that Hitler's supporters were largely from the lower middle class, Richard F. Hamilton analyzes Nazi electoral successes by turning to previously untapped sources--urban voting records. This examination of data from a series of elections in fourteen of the largest German cities shows that in most of them the vote for the Nazis varied directly with the class level of the district, with the wealthiest districts giving it the strongest support.

as PhD historian Jonathon House notes, the Nazis were extremely unprepared for a war with the Soviet Union: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zinPbUZUHDE
as amateur historian TIK notes, the USSR did not beat the Nazis with manpower alone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7BE8CsM9ds
despite having a smaller economy and facing millions of casualties, the USSR outproduced and outfought the Nazis: <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/totalwar2005.pdf> Yet table 1 showed that the Soviet Union was not superior to Germany in overall resources. Although Soviet GDP exceeded Germany’s in 1940, German wartime mobilization and the deep invasion of Soviet territory shifted the balance strongly in Germany’s favour. In the most critical years of the war overall Soviet resources were only 70 per cent of Germany’s, and the increment arising from Allied aid compensated only to a small extent. It is true that Germany was engaged on two fronts. Taking this into account, the Soviet Union still maintained a bigger army in the field than Germany and outproduced German industry systematically in weapons other than warships

the Nazis had plans to invade the USSR: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#German_invasion_plans>

the Communists did not have plans to invade Germany: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#Soviet_preparations> Historians have debated whether Stalin was planning an invasion of German territory in the summer of 1941. The debate began in the late-1980s when Viktor Suvorov published a journal article and later the book Icebreaker in which he claimed that Stalin had seen the outbreak of war in Western Europe as an opportunity to spread communist revolutions throughout the continent, and that the Soviet military was being deployed for an imminent attack at the time of the German invasion.[153] This view had also been advanced by former German generals following the war.[154] Suvorov's thesis was fully or partially accepted by a limited number of historians, including Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov, and Vladimir Nevezhin, and attracted public attention in Germany, Israel, and Russia.[155][156] It has been strongly rejected by most historians,[157][158] and Icebreaker is generally considered to be an "anti-Soviet tract" in Western countries.[159] David Glantz and Gabriel Gorodetsky wrote books to rebut Suvorov's arguments.[160] The majority of historians believe that Stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941, as he believed that his military was not ready to fight the German forces.[161]

# bloody sunday
Nazi saboteur units (Abwehr agents) opened fire on a retreating Polish army and were summarily executed. In response, the Polish army may have engaged in disorganized mob lynching that killed up to 300 Germans. The Nazi propaganda machine instructed the press that they "must show news on the barbarism of Poles in Bromberg". After German forces took the city, they executed 1800-3800 Poles as "revenge". <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1939)> On 04 October 1939, Adolf Hitler granted amnesty for all crimes committed by German military in Poland between 01 September and 04 October. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1939#October_4,_1939_(Wednesday)>

Staff from the Centre of Archaeology undertook non-invasive fieldwork at both Treblinka I and II in 2010, 2012 and 2013 in order to identify the locations of the camp boundaries, mass graves and gas chambers; aims that were successfully achieved [2], [3], [12]. This work involved walkover survey, topographic survey (with DGPS and a Total Station) and geophysical survey. Excavations were also undertaken in 2013 which confirmed the location of one of the gas chamber buildings and identified a number of personal belongings. During this fieldwork season, and a subsequent season in 2017, the methodology described below was employed in order to further characterize the terrain of, and evidence contained within, both camps.
yes, there have been archaeological studies of Treblinka -- using radar: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10761-017-0432-3> The excavation of Trench 4 confirmed that the 22 × 15 m anomaly in the GPR results did in fact represent the foundations of the first gas chambers built by the Nazis at Treblinka (known as the old gas chambers), which existed at a depth of 0.85 m below the ground. [....] Dentures, and gold and silver teeth were also found along with a considerable amount of fragmented human remains, some of which exhibited evidence of burning and some that did not. All of these different types of material traces were commingled, confirming the nature of destruction afforded to the gas chambers in autumn 1943 and the heavily disturbed nature of the ground exhibited in the GPR results.

# the holocaust is not separate from Western civilization
askHistorians post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4vgeki/marxist_historical_analyses_of_the_holocaust/d5zgkqz/> The historical understanding of Nazism and the Holocaust as »accidents of history« or part of a totalitarian trend averse to liberal, capitalist development are part of hegemonic discourse of portraying the current capitalist order as the best possible of all worlds and thus making them out to be the natural and unimporvable state of things often, consciously or unconsciously, aimed at squashing any kind of resistance against Capitalist hegemony. Understanding Nazism and the Holocaust as linked to factors inherent in capitalism – racism, colonialism, imperialism – is act of challenging the hegemony on the basis of its historical narrative. By historically rigorously pointing to these explicit links, a direct or indirect critique of the status quo, which in its most extreme forms can bring forward the catastrophe of Nazism, the hegemonic narrative is challenged and a blow of resistance is delivered.
askHistorians post: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4tln3x/steve_king_the_contributions_of_western_civ/d5ko61i/> Within historiography of the subject, the interesting thing to see is that the first two I mentioned are pretty much dead as of now and nobody would use them anymore. Generational and paradigm shifts as well as careful examination of the evidence have left us with only the latter two that understand Nazism as a product of modernity rather than it aberration or it being outside of modernity. Totalitarianism also doesn't hold up to historical examination, which leaves us with a variation of the last explanation, which is also in my opinion the most convincing.

Perhaps – Bordeaux noted – some of these viewpoints could be encouraged by the competition announcement and play a mandated role in the selection process.50 Having expressed his ‘immense pleasure’ with Bordeaux’s recommendations, Pius XI agreed on the need to restore ‘authority, order, and hierarchy’, according to ‘the principles of the Catholic Church’. Because communists and liberal ‘individualists’ (qua partisans of democracy) did not understand this, prize-winning novels should certainly celebrate authority and the Catholic religion.51 [....] The Pope accordingly suggested that it would be best for the book prize to reward anti-democratic, authoritarian, and religious political thinking, but be wary of lending support to extreme forms of nationalism that might be damaging to the Church and dilute its claims to standing at the helm of a transnational anti-communist movement."""

However, few scholars have noted the extent to which the Pope conceived of the three texts as integrally interrelated, and none have commented on the fact that the Secretariat on Atheism contributed decisively to their drafting. In April of 1936, the Superior General of the Jesuits responded to the news that Vatican theologians were in the midst of writing a theological critique of Nazism by informing the Pope that it was more urgent to draft an encyclical condemning ‘atheistic communism’, given the Soviet’s ‘ever-more intense propaganda’, and the need for ‘Catholics and others to unite in a more energetic and better-organized resistance’. ‘Your Holiness will pardon my boldness’, Ledo´chowski affirmed, suggesting that Secretariat personnel would be ideally suited to composing said text.64 Pius XI immediately accepted the proposal and put the head of the Secretariat on Atheism to work.65"""

# irish potato famine (occurred in a free market)
the irish potato famine occurred during a period of lassiez-faire UK domestic and trade policy: <https://whistlinginthewind.org/2012/08/25/laissez-faire-and-the-irish-great-famine/>
ireland was a net exporter during the famine: <http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf> One of the most remarkable facts about the famine period is that there was an average monthly export of food from Ireland worth 100,000 Pound Sterling. Almost throughout the five-year famine, Ireland remained a net exporter of food. (31.) Dr. Christine Kinealy, a fellow at the University of Liverpool and the author of two scholarly texts on the Irish Famine: This Great Calamity and A Death-Dealing Famine, says that 9,992 calves were exported from Ireland to England during "Black'47", an increase of thirty-three percent from the previous year. In the twelve months following the second failure of the potato crop, 4,000 horses and ponies were exported. The export of livestock to Britain (with the exception of pigs) increased during the "famine". The export of bacon and ham increased. In total, over three million live animals were exported from Ireland between 1846-50, more than the number of people who emigrated during the famine years.
ireland had previously banned exports during the 82-83 famine: <http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf> When Ireland experienced an earlier famine in 1782-83, ports were closed in order to keep home grown food for domestic consumption. Food prices were immediately reduced within Ireland. The merchants lobbied against such efforts, but their protests were over-ridden. Everyone recognized that the interests of the merchants and the distressed people were irreconcilable. In the Great Famine, that recognition was disregarded.
the "English blockade" and "three Turkish ships" are both memes: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5jcffu/was_englands_role_in_worsening_the_potato_famine/> <https://mikedashhistory.com/2014/12/29/queen-victorias-5-the-strange-tale-of-turkish-aid-to-ireland-during-the-great-famine/> According to the researches of Brendan Matthews, one of these ships was probably Prussian: she was named the Meta, and her home port was Stettin, on the Baltic Sea. The other two, however, came from the Balkans, which were then still under Ottoman control. They were the Porcupine and the Ann – two rather English names for ships – and they apparently had English masters, for their names were Cleveland and Cloid (Floyd?) Nonetheless, they had sailed from Ottoman Selânik (today Thessaloniki, in modern Greece). All three merchantmen carried cargoes of wheat and “Indian corn” – cheap maize, one of Ireland’s principal imports during the famine years. This is a remarkable find – more so given the rarity of foreign commerce in small Irish ports in those days – but it is only fair to point out that the newspapers contain a strong indication that the cargoes of the Porcupine and the Ann were trade goods, not charity; they were consigned to local merchants based in Louth and Meath, who it might be expected would sell them rather than give them away. Speculation in imported corn, moreover, was scarcely unheard-of two years into the Great Famine; the Ottomans grew it, and the owners of the Porcupine and the Ann presumably knew that they did.

Grain price rises in the Central Provinces had been fifty percent to one hundred percent in recent years. The “famine protective” Bengal Nagpur railway had accelerated price increases in areas like Sambalpur to the extent that locals could not cope, yet that same district showed net exports of food during the famine. The export trade brought new demand and pushed grain prices higher, while the depreciating rupee made Indian grain relatively cheap for English buyers.""""""In the Sagar (Saugor) district of the same “famine protected” railway region, the population was said to have increased by 18 percent, cultivable area by 48 percent over 1865-95, while wheat exports by rail increased from 40,000 maunds to 758,000 maunds over 1887-97."""

# railroads didn't protect against famine
many Indian famines were not merely regional, meaning that railroads alone could not stop them: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/financing-indias-imperial-railways-18751914/indian-railways-and-famines-18751914-magic-wheels-and-empty-stomachs/394F01F6B0F498022F5E9AAA3DB35869> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/701849862752436344/sweeney2014.pdf> """Much of the justification for this emphasis on railways relied on the assumption that Indian famines involved regional shortages rather than a lack of food across the subcontinent as a whole. This was a controversial assumption by the late 1890s, when the worst famine conditions in documented history appeared to be afflicting India, despite the decades of investment in famine protective railways. Even a former consultant to the GOI’s [Government of India] state railways, Horace Bell, was prepared to challenge this assumption. Bell highlighted the 1898 famine commission observation that the food production of British India was in deficit of eighteen to nineteen million tons over the years 1896-1897, and suggested that “an even greater deficiency” must have existed in the more widespread famine of 1898-l900. Government-funded food imports could solve food shortages. Railways and the price mechanism would not be sufficient. In fact, the rise in grain prices during these famines failed to encourage grain traders to target the Indian market since export prices to Britain were still higher. Grain wages were required as part of famine relief due to the poverty of the unemployed Indian peasants. Only Burma, within British India, could offer substantial additional foodstuffs (grain and rice), but the shipping and rail costs from that region made the likely grain/rice price “prohibitive”."""

In 1919, an Indian legislature, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly, took over the legislative functions of the Viceroy's Council. The viceroy nonetheless retained significant power over legislation. He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature's consent for "ecclesiastical, political [and] defense" purposes, and for any purpose during "emergencies." He was permitted to veto, or even stop debate on, any bill. If he recommended the passage of a bill, but only one chamber cooperated, he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber. The Legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence. The president of the Council of State was appointed by the viceroy; the Legislative Assembly elected its president, but the election required the viceroy's approval.

# heather on prior immigration
tribal immigration was previously dealt with by Rome by breaking them up and selling them off as slaves: <https://academic.oup.com/ehr/article/CX/435/4/495571> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/ehr/CX.435.4> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/709456552330789044/heather1995.pdf> """Immigration, even large-scale immigration, was not at all a new phe- nomenon; the Empire had a long history of resettling immigrants within its borders.2 Up to the 370s, however, this was done on Roman terms, or else resisted. In the 350s, for instance, the Emperor Julian only pre- tended to be willing to treat with some Salian Franks who had taken possession of Roman territory, to put them off their guard. He then followed up with the army and dealt with them as he pleased.3 The traditional policy towards immigrants, indeed, was thorough military and political subjugation followed by widely dispersed settlement in small groups, an approach obviously designed to minimize any security risk.4"""
Rome attempted to enact the same policies during the Hunnic era: <https://academic.oup.com/ehr/article/CX/435/4/495571> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/ehr/CX.435.4> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/709456552330789044/heather1995.pdf> """Such policies were not abandoned in the Hunnic era for want of trying. In 376, only one of the two Gothic groups which crossed the Danube unsubdued - the Tervingi - did so with Roman permission, and then only because Roman forces were tied up on the Persian front. And even those Goths allowed to cross were then subject to general harass- ment and an attempt (again following standard Roman practice) to assassinate or kidnap their leaders at a banquet given by the local Roman commander. The Empire made a full peace with both groups only in October 382 after six years of warfare, during which several Gothic subgroups had been wiped out, and, until the heavy defeat at Hadria- nople in 378, where the Emperor Valens and two-thirds of his army fell on a single afternoon, imperial policy had been directed precisely to reversing the temporary asylum granted some Goths out of necessity in 376. Even after 382, the Empire was probably still looking to undermine the Gothic autonomy which it ostensibly tolerated.5 Nor did this one enforced modification lead to a more general change in policy. As wehave seen, Odotheus received short shrift in 386, and the Roman state responded aggressively to the crisis of 405-8. Radagaisus was killed and his followers dispersed; so many were sold as slaves that the bottom fell out of the market (Orosius 7. 37. I3 ff.). No concessions were made to Uldin, and many of the Sciri who followed him were again turned into slaves or individual tenant-farmers parcelled out to Roman landowners. Likewise, when an effective response to the Rhine crossing did eventu- ally emerge, one of the two Vandal groups which, together with the Alans, crossed the Pyrenees ceased to exist as an independent unit. In subsequent years, many Suevi similarly fell by the wayside."""

# ward-perkins: external invasion (summarizations by askhistorians, unformatted)
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> Rome fell to violent barbarian invasions. Additionally, he takes a materialist approach, focusing his analysis heavily on archaeological evidence, which he believes demonstrates that a substantive decline accompanied the collapse of the Roman state – the primary engine of the classical economy. Like heather, his analysis of the fall is largely monocausal, focusing on the Germanic invaders destruction of the Roman tax base. 'the disappearance of comfort': the decline in high-quality mass-produced goods being widely available well down the social scale; the disappearance of the impressive but fragile long-range trade networks characteristic of the empire; the greatly reduced scale and more primitive style of what little public building (for example, churches) was attempted; the general replacement of strong and elegant brick or stone housing and terra cotta roof tile by cruder thatch and wood houses; even the pitifully withered robustness of the average cow (see the striking illustration on p. 145). These losses are vivid concrete evidence of the fall of Rome.
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> Rather, there were simply too many military threats in too many places, and too many military and economic limitations, for the Romans to be able to afford a strong enough response to these threats, and not enough troops to save the west. 
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> When these conditions collapsed, standards of living declined. Tableware, luxury goods, good pottery, good tools, sturdy tiled roofs, good buildings of all sorts: all disappeared. Large churches and basilicas, everyday coinage and commercial exchange, the wide distribution of goods and foodstuffs, ease of travel and communication: all disappeared. The fall of Rome brought a sharp decline in literacy, as well as in the unity of language (Latin, as opposed to numerous Germanic dialects), in widely accessible education, in the use of written records and documents, and in the production of literature and history-writing and the whole mentality this reflects.
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> Above all, there was in the post-Roman Latin West a rise of localism: a society composed of small, fairly isolated rural settlements that were more or less selfsufficient economically and self-sufficient in local defence, relying mainly on local potentes (armed elites and warlords with small private armies or bodyguards). The decline of sophisticated, centralized government, and the rise of localism, meant that basic needs and the demands for survival left most people no free time for education, art, literature, and architecture.
Ward-Perkins: <https://u1lib.org/book/637663/12360a> And as Ward-Perkins shows, with the collapse of centralized and unified Roman political authority and of a complex economy and system of trade, the civilization of the west also collapsed.

# goldsworthy: internal weaknesses
summarization by askhistorians, unformatted: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3s8avg/fall_of_the_roman_empire/> This led to a devastating vicious cycle: The empire is under threat. A local commander takes action, but then makes a bid for power and starts a civil war. This reduces the strength of the frontier. This encourages Rome's enemies to mount raids and invasions. This forces local commanders to take action, which then causes a new round of civil wars. This process led to the crisis of the third century, wherein 30 emperors ruled in a period of 50 years. The Danubian soldier-emperors of the late 3rd/early 4th centuries restored order, though, and under emperors such as Diocletian and Constantine a new series of reforms took place. Armies too were centralised: the emperors now started to keep large field armies with them at all times, so they could respond to threats, but more importantly so they would be safeguarded from usurpation by their commanders. This system worked, but it came at a price. This reduced the risk of civil war, but increased the tax burden on the empire and weakened border defences Goldsworthy describes a process in which imperial authority always tried to draw support from "safe" social classes. Augustus relied on the Ordo Equester, the second-tier Roman nobility often translated as "knights", because senators would be too likely to see themselves as his equals and usurp authority. However, by Diocletian's time, it had become common practice for men of relatively low birth to become emperors. The class was no longer safe. The habit of using German military strongmen started. As outsiders, often reviled by Roman elites, such men could not realistically hope to achieve imperial titles for themselves. However, that did not last long. In the 5th century, these military leaders started using a succession of weak emperors in the east and west as puppets. It was the German military leaders who had the real power, and used it against eachother in new series of civil wars, even though ostensibly the same Roman emperor might sit on the throne for long periods of time. So again, short-term stability soon devolved into new internal weakness. It was these weaknesses which then enabled the Germanic invaders of the 4th and 5th centuries to replace the central Roman authority. As Goldsworthy puts it: """[The Roman Empire] may well have been "murdered" by barbarian invaders, but these struck at a body made vulnerable by long decay."""

This would differ a lot from area to area, and close inspections on the available material haven't been done for many places, where they were done they have sometimes lead to higher estimates than expected. It's an interesting question, and a subject of constant inquiry. Text was very important and ubiquitous in the Roman world, and some levels of basic understanding must have been there for most people."""

It has been calculated that 50-60% of a free adult Roman’s lead intake probably came from wine. The nobility and the rich, who drank up to 2 L wine per day, would thus have been predisposed to lead poisoning. Pewter ware was extensively used by the middle class. It is calculated that the Roman aristocrat probably took in 250 mg of lead per day, the plebeian 35 mg, and the slave 15 mg. This compares with 30-50 mg of lead per day for the average contemporary adult in the United States. WHO considers 45 mg per day as the maximal lead intake for a healthy individual (Nriagu, 1983; Needleman and Needleman, 1985)."""

# western african non-adoption of the wheel
Chaves Engerman Robinson 2013: the "Africans were too dumb to use wheels" explanation is circular and absurd; while wheels, particularly railroads, were ultimately very economically beneficial in Western Africa, they had a startup cost that coould not be overcome: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w19673> <https://sci-hub.st/10.3386/w19673> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1071747186234245160/chaves2013.pdf> Reinventing the Wheel: The Economic Benefits of Wheeled Transportation in Early British Colonial West Africa. """The conventional notion that Africans failed to employ the wheel because of lack of initiative or intelligence is intellectually unsatisfactory, not so much because it is racialist as because it is circular: Africans are supposed to have ignored the wheel because they were unenterprising, and the evidence that they were unenterprising is that they failed to adopt the wheel. In other contexts, notably in their widespread adoption of the use of imported European firearms, Africans proved eagerly receptive to innovation, and it cannot therefore be argued that they were in general conservative in their responses to new technology. There must, logically, be some special explanation for their lack of interest in the practical application of the technology of wheeled transport."""
Law 1980: Western African civilizations were trapped in a vicious circle (a classic example of the "low-income trap"): <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/abs/wheeled-transport-in-precolonial-west-africa/EA4BFAEDA97B73E8201B16D2E0D83D35> <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1159117> <https://sci-hub.st/10.2307/1159117> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1071747659108462703/law1980.pdf> Wheeled Transport in Pre-Colonial West Africa """But it was nonsensical to advocate the introduction of wheeled transport in order to stimulate road improvement: heavy expenditure on road improvement would only be attractive if wheeled transport promised commensurate savings, and the experience of 1841 might equally reasonably have prompted the discouraging conclusion that the costs involved were so great as to be prohibitive. The costs of road improvement, moreover, would have to be incurred in advance of any savings to be derived from the use of wheeled vehicles, and thus represented a very speculative venture as long as wheeled vehicles were not already in general use. Even the British colonial government in the Gold Coast baulked at the gamble in 1870, concluding that roads suitable for wheeled traffic would be too expensive to build and were in any case undesirable since 'even if good roads were built, there would be no vehicles to travel on them' (Dickson 1971:218-219). **Thus, wheeled transport could not be adopted without improved roads, but the roads would not be improved as long as there was no wheeled transport to use them. Only governments committed to a more aggressive ideology of economic progress, and therefore ready to incur speculative expenses in the confidence of ultimate economic advantage, could break out of this vicious circle; and such governments arrived in West Africa only with the European imperialism of the late nineteenth century.**"""

With only a few exceptions found in coastal polities incorporated into the empire, there was no trading class in Inca society, and the development of individual wealth acquired through commerce was not possible. Local political units were ideally to be as self-sufficient as possible in producing their own basic economic requirements. A few products deemed essential by the Incas could not be produced locally and had to be imported. In these cases several strategies were employed, such as establishing colonies in specific production zones for particular commodities and permitting limited long-distance trade. The production, distribution, and use of commodities were centrally controlled by the Inca government. Each citizen of the empire was issued the necessities of life out of the state storehouses, including food, tools, raw materials, and clothing, and needed to purchase nothing. With no shops or markets, there was no need for a standard currency or money, and there was nowhere to spend money or purchase or trade for necessities."""

The behavioral changes associated with the Upper Paleolithic record signal a wider range of economic and technological roles in forager societies, and these changes may have provided the expanding populations of Homo sapiens with a demographic advantage over other hominins in Eurasia."""

^ Angel 1984: skeletons in Greece and Turkey suggest that male and female height declined after the shift to agriculture, male lifespan was unchanged until ~4000 YBP, female lifespan dropped by 1 year until ~4000 YBP, and urbanicity increased enormously (by about 2500x): <https://books.google.com/books/about/Paleopathology_at_the_Origins_of_Agricul.html?id=4cilNAEACAAJ> <https://u1lib.org/book/1216183/7d369d> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/728300132851777546/unknown.png

For example, the health of Egyptians 12,000 years ago, shortly after the shift to farming from foraging, was poor. But by 4,000 years ago, height had returned to pre-agricultural levels and evidence of malnutrition in tooth enamel was lower than that of their hunter gatherer comparators. Agriculturalists adapted to their new diet and environment.""""""Then a funny thing happened on the way from the preagricultural Mediterranean to the giant farms of today: people, at least some of them, got healthier, presumably as we adapted to the new way of life and food became more evenly distributed. The collection of skeletons from Egypt also shows that by 4,000 years ago, height had returned to its preagricultural levels, and only 20 percent of the population had telltale signs of poor nutrition in their teeth. Those trying to make the point that agriculture is bad for our bodies generally use skeletal material from immediately after the shift to farming as evidence, but a more long-term view is starting to tell a different story. For example, Timothy Gage of the State University of New York at Albany examined long-term mortality records from around the world, along with the likeliest causes of death, and concluded that life span did not decrease, nor did many diseases increase, after agriculture. Some illnesses doubtless grew worse after humans settled down, but life has had its “nasty, brutish, and short” phases at many points throughout history.""" [unformatted]

A full five thousand years later, in 5,000 BCE, it had risen only to 5 million. This hardly represents a population explosion, despite the civilizational achievements of the Neolithic revolution: sedentism and agriculture. Over the subsequent five thousand years, by contrast, world population would grow twentyfold, to more than 100 million. The five thousand-year Neolithic transition was thus something of a demographic bottleneck, reflecting a nearly static level of reproduction. Supposing even a population growth rate just barely over replacement levels (for example, 0.015 percent) the total population would have still more than doubled over these five millennia. One likely explanation for this paradox of apparent human progress in subsistence techniques together with long period of demographic stagnation is that, epidemiologically, this was perhaps the most lethal period in human history. In the case of Mesopotamia, the claim is that, owing precisely to the effects of the Neolithic revolution, it had become the focal point of chronic and acute infectious diseases that devastated the population again and again."""

Point to the benefits of climate action for health, well-being, and social justice, drawing on sources trusted by the audience. Such an approach can motivate people to act and help them avoid feelings of guilt, despair, or apathy (Bain et al., 2016; Geiger et al., 2019; Markowitz & Guckian, 2018; Ojala, 2012)."""

Although this makes intuitive sense, the vast majority of existing climate communication does just the opposite, highlighting the anthropogenic causes of the problem as well as the multitude of diverse and depressing anticipated impacts of unmitigated and continued climate change without a clear focus on what can be done to remedy the situation (see Hart & Feldman, 2014). The problem is that such negative, risk-oriented messaging, while likely aligning well with the motives and concerns of many climate communicators, tends to increase the salience of the issue at the cost of depressing individuals’ feelings of efficacy and motivation to take action (e.g., Chapman et al., 2016; O’Neill et al., 2013). Moreover, and more importantly, such impacts-focused messaging leads many individuals and audiences to simply turn off from the issue, if not spiral into unproductive denial or feelings of hopelessness (Feinberg & Willer, 2011; Hulme, 2009). Such problematic messaging is perpetuated by the popular press and media (Painter, 2013), which inconsistently convey threat and efficacy messages while framing climate change impacts and actions (Hart & Feldman, 2014)."""

In turn, this can provide a concrete goal for individuals and communities to work toward, building both motivation to take action on the issue and a sense of personal and collective efficacy (Lee & Aaker, 2004; Roser-Renouf, Maibach, Leiserowitz, & Zhao, 2014; Witte, 1992). Moreover, solutions-focused messages and outreach strategies allow individuals to worry about the issue in ways that promote rather than inhibit engagement and, often, to identify cobenefits of taking action sooner rather than later (e.g., improving air quality and public health), further building motivation to engage (Bain et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2012). Indeed, practitioners and communicators alike are engaging in meaningful efforts to generate detailed, coherent visualizations of future climate scenarios embedded with planning solutions at the local scale to increase both collective capacity as well as mitigative and adaptive policy support (Cohen et al., 2012; Shaw et al., 2009; Sheppard, 2012). This is an important and ripe area for future research, as it remains largely unknown exactly which combinations of concern-evoking, impacts-focused messages, and hope-inspiring, positive visions of the future are likely to be most effective."""

As of 2017, the cost (before tax credits that would further drop the costs) of wind power was $30-60 per megawatt-hour (a measure of energy), and large-scale solar cost $43-53/MWh.

Coal: Huge numbers of birds, roughly 7.9 million, may be killed by coal, according to analysis by Benjamin K. Sovacool, director of the Danish Center for Energy Technologies. His estimate, however, included everything from mining to production and climate change, which together amounted to about five birds per gigawatt-hour of energy generated by coal.

# human survivability and oxygen
with evolution, humans appear able to survive with oxygen pressure as low as half of that today: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5138252/> """The highest permanent settlement on record is the (now abandoned) Chilean mining village of Quilcha (5340 m), which was discovered by the 1935 International High Altitude Expedition to Chile [39]. It has been argued that this represents the upper limit of long-term human habitation, because the residents chose to sleep at this elevation and make a daily ascent to the mine above. PatO2 at the Quilcha settlement is 11.3 kPa (slightly higher than 50% of the current PatO2 at sea level). The parabolic deoxygenation model described here predicts that PatO2 at sea level will reach this threshold in ~3600 years from now. During this time, the human species is likely to undergo further positive selection for physiological phenotypes conveying survival advantage in hypoxic conditions. Studies of high-altitude residents tell us that while such adaptations may enable us to function relatively well in an atmosphere that contains just over half the oxygen we breathe today; many will suffer the long-term consequences."""

None of the other phytoplankton groups exhibited a significant change globally, but regionally there were considerable significant trends. A decline in nutrients in the northernmost latitudes coincided with a significant decline in diatoms (North Pacific, −1.00% yr−1) and chlorophytes (North Atlantic, −9.70% yr−1).

# phytoplankton adaptation
one species of phytoplankton rose from 2 to 20% abundance from 1965 to 2010 in the North Atlantic Ocean: <https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6267/1533.abstract> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1126/science.aaa8026> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/700875021987610644/unknown.png """`The CPR data shows an increase in occurrence of coccolithophores across the North Atlantic from ~1% of samples in the 1960s to over 20% of samples with coccolithophores in the 2000s (Fig. 1, A to F, and fig. S2)""""""We hypothesize that synergistic effects due to CO2, AMO [Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation], and global warming differentially accelerated coccolithophore growth rates, driving recent increases in their occurrence. Compared to other phytoplankton groups, coccolithophore photosynthesis is severely carbon-limited (2) and sedimentary records show a predominance of coccolithophores during interglacial (22) and high CO2 periods (23)."""
within 100 generations, a model phytoplankton adapted to the point of equal growth rates in a shift of 20dC to 33dC: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.12545> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/ele.12545> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/700876368124051456/unknown.png """In our experiment, growth rates increased exponentially between 20 and 30 °C after 10 generations, though at 33 °C, the capacity for physiological acclimation to facilitate further increases in growth was insufficient. In line with our expectations, CUE [Carbon-Use Efficiency] declined with increasing selection temperature, and at 33 °C growth was presumably limited by low CUE. Evolutionary responses in phytoplankton, either via selection on pre-existing genotype variation (Lohbeck et al. 2012) or de novo mutations, are frequently observed within 100 generations (Schaum & Collins 2014; Schluter € et al. 2014), and in our experiment, after 100 generations, growth at 33 °C had increased to levels predicted from the exponential relationship between temperature and growth. Consistent with our hypothesis, elevated thermal tolerance evolved via increases in CUE mediated by greater down-regulation of specific rates of respiration, R(Tc) relative to those of photosynthesis, P(Tc). These findings provide direct evidence that selection on metabolic traits provides a mechanistic explanation for the evolution of elevated thermal tolerance in a model phytoplankton."""
The first was published in the journal Science, and looked at data from the past 50 years. The paper's authors found one particular species of phytoplankton from the North Atlantic has thrived. In fact, its population has increased almost tenfold since 1965. That's an incredibly surprising finding for the researchers. It has long been thought that organisms like these would be particularly sensitive to the increase in acidity that is measured in the oceans today. <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eva.12120> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/eva.12120>
In another study also published this week, researchers like Daniel Padfield from the University of Exeter explored temperature adaptations of plankton. And he says they adapted quickly. "At 33 degrees centigrade, which is the highest temperature where they were stressed out, they initially grew below what we would expect," he said. "However, after just 45 days, they evolved increased growth rates. So essentially, they increased their thermal tolerance, so the range of temperatures in which they're capable of surviving, after only 45 days." <https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1441> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1038/ngeo1441>
Only up to a point. In a third study published this week, in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, researchers from the University of Leicester predicted that a six-degree rise in ocean temperature will prevent phytoplankton from surviving. That would mean the loss of the oxygen they produce through photosynthesis.: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11538-015-0126-0> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/s11538-015-0126-0>

They have involved more than a 25% decrease of European colonies since the mid-1980s and nearly a 60% decrease in the U.S. (Fig. 1) (Potts et al. 2010a). The collapse of the U.S.S.R. in the 1990s reduced governmental financing of beekeeping in former Soviet countries of eastern Europe, causing a 50% reduction in managed colony numbers there (Aizen and Harder 2009). In western Europe, higher production costs, competition from cheaper imported honey, and increased affordability of sugar-based products have led to a 30% decrease in beekeepers and a 25% decrease in colony numbers since 1985 (Aizen and Harder 2009; Potts et al. 2010a). Honey demand and prices had already fallen in the U.S. at the end of WWII, making beekeeping less profitable. Declines were compounded by rapid expansion of honey importation from China, Argentina, and Vietnam during the 1960s leading to reduced demand for domestic honey (Daberkow et al. 2009; vanEngelsdorp and Meixner 2010). [....] Additionally, long-term declines in the U.S. may be artificially heightened by the counting methods used by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). A widely cited reduction by one million colonies during the 1980s (Fig. 1) coincides with NASS discontinuing the inclusion of colonies from operations with five or fewer hives (vanEngelsdorp and Meixner 2010)."""

Higher wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) values in the bloom years correlated well with lower SSTs [sea surface temperatures] and stronger upwelling (Fig. 2) (36, 37). Evidence for nutrient enrichment is also found in the Sargassum nutrient compositions. Specifically, the N:P [nitrogen:phosphorous] ratios of the recent neritic samples show an increasingly P-limited growth compared with the historical baselines, which would be a result of long-term nutrient enrichment, especially N enrichment, in recent years (24). Other evidence to support recent nutrient enrichment in the central west Atlantic comes from increased deforestation and fertilizer use in Brazil and increased water-column nitrogen from 2010 to 2018 (fig.

Caribbean Sargassum cleanup costs $120 million in 2018: <https://forimmediaterelease.net/sargassum-clean-up-costs-caribbean-us120-million-bartlett-707152/> Caribbean GDP 2018: $360 billion --> Sargassum cleanup = 0.033% of GDP (12.42 Bahamas, 101.1 `, 1.011 St. Kitts, 1.611 Antigua, 23.81 Trinidad, 5.145 Barbados, 1.186 Grenada, 1.922 St. Lucia, 100 Cuba, 85.56 Dominican Republic, 0.811 St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 15.71 Jamaica, 9.659 Haiti)

# economic gains: fertilizer
sargassum can be processed as fertilizer: <https://www.gfmag.com/magazine/june-2019/caribbean-economies> Johanan Dujon, of St. Lucia, saw an opportunity outside the tourist industry. He began harvesting the seaweed and turned it into an organic fertilizer, founding Algas Organics in 2014. “I started this company with a vision to convert what many people saw as an environmental and economic threat into the world’s most innovative fertilizer company,” he explains. Algas Organics has processed more than 3 million pounds of Sargassum since starting production in 2015, simultaneously cleaning beaches and supporting local agriculture with an organic fertilizer.

# economic gains: food
some kinds of seaweed can be used as food: <https://cen.acs.org/environment/sustainability/Netherlands-building-seaweed-industry/97/i34> """Setting aside just 2% of Earth’s sea surface for seaweed cultivation would ensure enough food for the whole world, according to WUR. Compared with raising animals, sugar kelp production has a far lower impact on greenhouse gas emissions per unit of protein and avoids issues associated with land use. Making sugar kelp attractive and affordable at large scale will require private and public intervention, however, Parodi warns in his study."""

# economic-ecological gains: biogas
sargassum can be used for biogas production, but it appears to require pretreatment: <https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/11/3/494> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.3390/en11030494> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/700346348775669810/tapia-tussell2018.pdf> """In fact, the fungal pretreatment produced a 20% increase in methane yield, with important amounts of alkali metals Ca, K, Mg, Na of 78 g/L, ash 35.5% and lignin 15.6%. It is unlikely that high concentrations of ash and alkali metals will produce an ideal feedstock for combustion or pyrolysis, but they can be recommended for a biological process."""

# economic-medical gains: antibiotic
Sargassum likely contains an antibiotic of unknown identity: <https://cen.acs.org/content/cen/articles/97/i34/Sargassum-strangling-tourism-Caribbean-scientists.html> """Milledge, whose background is in biofuels, is interested in testing the seaweed’s viability as a feedstock for biogas—the gases, such as methane, that are emitted by microbes as they digest the seaweed. “Although its empirical formula would indicate that it’s got a good biogas potential, it doesn’t in practice produce very much biogas,” he says. The reason may be that the seaweed contains compounds inhibiting the bacteria trying to digest it. Milledge’s ideal scenario would be to identify those inhibitors, extract them, and then market them for their antibacterial properties. Removing them for sale would be a win-win because it would allow the microbes to chow down on the seaweed and increase biogas yield."""
some algae contain an antibiotic (β-glucan) that may increase gut resistance to infection: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840118306783> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2018.12.004> """Results of this experiment revealed that inclusion of high dose βglucan reduced (P < 0.05) frequency of diarrhea (29.01% vs. 17.28%) for the entire experimental period. This was likely due to the reduced (P < 0.05) gut permeability and increased (P < 0.05) mRNA expression of gut barrier function genes (Claudin, Occludin, and MUC2) in jejunal mucosa of E. coli challenged pigs as β-glucan supplemented. Supplementation of β-glucan also reduced (P < 0.05) white blood cells, neutrophils, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, cortisol, and haptoglobin, and down-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of several immune genes (IL1B, IL6, and TNFA) in ileal mucosa of E. coli challenged pigs, compared with the control diet. In conclusion, in feed supplementation of algae-derived β-glucan alleviated diarrhea of F18 E. coli infected pigs by enhancing gut integrity.

# marx's view not a dogma to be learned by heart
Marx 1887: "Our theory is a theory of evolution, not a dogma to be learned by heart and to be repeated mechanically." <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1887/letters/87_01_27.htm> """The movement in America, just at this moment, is I believe best seen from across the ocean. On the spot personal bickerings and local disputes must obscure most of the grandeur of it. And the only thing that could really delay its march would be a consolidation of these differences into established acts. To some extent that will be unavoidable, but the less of it the better. And the Germans have most to guard against this. Our theory is a theory of evolution, not a dogma to be learned by heart and to be repeated mechanically. The less it is drilled into the Americans from outside and the more they test it with their own experience--with the help of the Germans--the deeper will it pass into their flesh and blood. When we returned to Germany, in spring 1848, we joined the Democratic Party as the only possible means of getting the ear of the working class; we were the most advanced wing of that party, but still a wing of it. When Marx founded the International, he drew up the General Rules in such a way that all working-class socialists of that period could join it -- Proudhonists, Pierre Lerouxists and even the more advanced section of the English Trades Unions; and it was only through this latitude that the International became what it was, the means of gradually dissolving and absorbing all these minor sects, with the exception of the Anarchists, whose sudden appearance in various countries was but the effect of the violent bourgeois reaction after the Commune and could therefore safely be left by us to die out of itself, as it did. Had we from 1864, to 1873 insisted on working together only with those who openly adopted our platform where should we be to-day? I think that all our practice has shown that it is possible to work along with the general movement of the working class at every one of its stages without giving up or hiding our own distinct position and even organisation, and I am afraid that if the German Americans choose a different line they will commit a great mistake."""

For this purpose, we should, as Marx has said, appropriate the material in detail and subject it to scientific analysis and synthesis. Many of our people do not act in this way but do the opposite. A good number of them are doing research work but have no interest in studying either the China of today or the China of yesterday and confine their interest to the study of empty "theories" divorced from reality. Many others are doing practical work, but they too pay no attention to the study of objective conditions, often rely on sheer enthusiasm and substitute their personal feelings for policy. Both kinds of people, relying on the subjective, ignore the existence of objective realities. When making speeches, they indulge in a long string of headings, A, B, C, D, 1, 2, 3, 4, and when writing articles, they turn out a lot of verbiage. They have no intention of seeking truth from facts, but only a desire to curry favour by claptrap. They are flashy without substance, brittle without solidity. They are always right, they are the Number One authority under Heaven, "imperial envoys" who rush everywhere. Such is the style of work of some comrades in our ranks.

It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object.

Now in Capital Marx has amply demonstrated that the laws governing wages are very complex, that, according to circumstances, now this law, now that, holds sway, that they are therefore by no means iron but are, on the contrary, exceedingly elastic, and that the subject really cannot be dismissed in a few words, as Lassalle imagined. Malthus’ argument, upon which the law Lassalle derived from him and Ricardo (whom he misinterpreted) is based, as that argument appears, for instance, on p. 5 of the Arbeiterlesebuch, where it is quoted from another pamphlet of Lassalle’s, [9] is exhaustively refuted by Marx in the section on “Accumulation of Capital.” Thus, by adopting the Lassallean “iron law” one commits oneself to a false proposition and false reasoning in support of the same."""

In capitalist terms, this means a progressive decrease in expenses for living labour, in wages, relative to the expenses for inanimate means of production. Contrary to the assumption of Adam Smith and Ricardo, enlarged reproduction must not only start with the division of the capitalised part of the surplus value into constant and variable capital, but, as the technique of production advances, it is bound to allocate in this division ever increasing portions to the constant, and ever diminishing portions to the variable capital.

[....] The increasing growth of variable capital which accompanies accumulation must therefore become manifest in ever greater numbers of employed labour. Where can this additional labour be found? [....] Thus the increase in the variable capital is directly and exclusively attributed to the natural physical increase of a working class already dominated by capital. Since capitalist production can develop fully only with complete access to all territories and climes, it can no more confine itself to the natural resources and productive forces of the temperate zone than it can manage with white labour alone. Capital needs other races to exploit territories where the white man cannot work.

# labor theory of value: terminology
#####o
use-value is the utility of a given good to a given consumer (can vary across consumers)
exchange-value is the value for which a good can be exchanged from one person to another (aka price)
capital-v Value or just "value" is the abstract, combined value of a good
labor - physical act of labor, what proletariat does
labor power - capacity to do labor, what proletariat sells to bourgeoise

# marx quotes: labor vs labor power
Marx 1875: wages represent a worker's sale of labor power; he performs both paid labor (labor income, wages) and free labor (profits, surplus value): <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/Marx_Critque_of_the_Gotha_Programme.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865284162122285076/mecw24.pdf> """Since Lassalle's death, there has asserted itself in our party the scientific understanding that wages are not what they appear to be -- namely, the value, or price, of labor—but only a masked form for the value, or price, of labor power. Thereby, the whole bourgeois conception of wages hitherto, as well as all the criticism hitherto directed against this conception, was thrown overboard once and for all. It was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence—that is, to live, only insofar as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist (and hence also for the latter's co-consumers of surplus value); that the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this gratis labor by extending the working day, or by developing the productivity—that is, increasing the intensity or labor power, etc.; that, consequently, the system of wage labor is a system of slavery, and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labor develop, whether the worker receives better or worse payment."""

The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour."""

# labor theory of value: critique 1: the mainstream theory of general equilibrium
#####o
# summary
The mainstream economic theory of price is a combined supply-side and demand-side model called general equilibrium. Its modern form was formally stated by Ken Arrow and Gerard Debreu in the 1950's. Classical economists Adam Smith and Karl Marx argued that the relative ratio of usual prices (exchange-values) of two goods should be equal to the ratio of labor-time required to usually produce the good. There is no reason to believe price is determined only on the supply side.

# the ltv as a supply-side theory
Roemer: the labor theory of value is a purely supply-side theory of price, but accurate price theories must include demand-side as well: <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/897508359509512202/unknown.png In fact, the labor theory of value is a supply-side theory, in which prices are thought to be determined entirely by their labor costs; in contrast, emphasizing the importance of the degree to which a commodity fulfills desires or needs or welfare in determining its price is the demand side. The correct theory of market price must take both supply and demand into account. There are some special cases in which demand will not affect price, which is technologically determined, but recourse to those cases should not be sought in an attempt to defend the labor theory of value.
Roemer: the labor theory of value's theoretical foundation (that the only thing in common between commodities is value embodied from labor) is not valid; all products share, at least, the fact that they are desired (a set of use-values): <https://u1lib.org/book/815428/4e2811> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/782280843875319808/roemer1988.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/897508330614980608/unknown.png

The proportions in which they are exchangeable, whatever those proportions may be, can always be represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron: e.g. 1 quarter corn = x cwt iron. **What does this equation tell us? It tells us that in two different things - in 1 quarter of corn and x cwt of iron, there exists in equal quantities something common to both.** The two things must therefore be equal to a third, which in itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of them, so far as it is exchange val'ue, must therefore be reducible to this third."""

Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight.

Let us now consider the residue of each of these products; it consists of the same unsubstantial reality in each, a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour, of labour power expended without regard to the mode of its expenditure.** All that these things now tell us is, that human labour power has been expended in their production, that human labour is embodied in them.

The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour."""

If under normal, i.e., average social conditions of production, a pounds of cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hour’s labour, then a day’s labour does not count as 12 hours’ labour unless 12 a pounds of cotton have been made into 12 b pounds of yarn; for in the creation of value, the time that is socially necessary alone counts. Not only the labour, but also the raw material and the product now appear in quite a new light, very different from that in which we viewed them in the labour-process pure and simple.

# labor theory of value: magarino quotes
#####o
Magarino: LTV explains relative prices: <https://youtu.be/0fLdVq4eCYc?t=206> The labor theory of value is clearly not a scientfic theory in the sense of belonging to natural sciences, but it is is a scientific theory as it belongs to the social sciences. It is a theory that tries to explain something about political economy. And what exactly does it try to explain? It tries to explain relative prices in capitalist societies where commodity exchange is generalized.
Magarino: LTV explains the fundamental value of a commodity (around which actual market prices fluctuate): <https://youtu.be/0fLdVq4eCYc?t=428> The definition of value, in Marx, is abstract socially necessary labor time. And this being value, what he now does is say, this is actually going to say a lot about the way in which commodities exchange against one another in the market. And as we are going to see, he's goign to build the prices of production based on this labor, and these are going to be basically the fundamental prices, so these are going to be, in the same way that the fundamental value of a stock in financial theory is the total sum of dividends discounted at the interest rate, in the labor theory of value, we say that the fundamental value of a commodity is this price of production, which is the center of gravity of the actual market price. So it's not going to be necessarily equal, but it's going to the the regulator of market prices, but this is actually testable.
Magarino: LTV applies only to commodities, which are objects which people desire to exchange: <https://youtu.be/0fLdVq4eCYc?t=531> Marx makes it very clear in the first chapter of Das Kapital, that commodities are useful objects, and therefore people want to purchase them. If someone doesn't want to purchase an object, that object cannot be a commodity, because a commodity is a use value that has an exchange value. If an object has no use value, no one wants to buy it, it cannot have an exchange value, and it's therefore not a commodity.

It is hard to see why this should be regarded as the one property that all produced commodities have in common. They also share the property of being desired by people; and that property gives rise to a welfare-based theory of value (which is reflected in the statement occurring in neoclassical economic theory that prices are proportional to marginal utilities)."""

# labor theory of value: evidence 1: cross-sectional value correlations
#####o
# summary
The correlation between hours of labor in a sector and output of that sector is very weak evidence, as it is a spurious correlation largely based on sector size.

# kliman 2002 introduces the spurious correlation critique
Kliman 2002 first replicates the strong correlation results of earlier pro-LTV studies: <https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/26/3/299/1711462> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/cje/26.3.299> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787155135120801852/kliman2002.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787164779520983050/unknown.png """The measures of distance indicate that prices differed from adjusted values by an average of about +/-8% to +/-13%. Such results, and even somewhat weaker ones, are typically taken as providing strong confirmation that values are ‘close’ to market prices. Yet what can we infer from this ‘closeness’—and what can we not validly infer?"""
Kliman 2002 then adjusts the price and value of each sector by its aggregate labour and non-labour costs (which is a strong proxy for industry size): <https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/26/3/299/1711462> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/cje/26.3.299> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787155135120801852/kliman2002.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787166363571453952/unknown.png
Kliman 2002: after adjustment for industry size, no correlation between labor input and value occurs: <https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/26/3/299/1711462> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/cje/26.3.299> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787155135120801852/kliman2002.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787168573180739604/unknown.png """Once the effects of industry size are removed, it is not the case that prices are high in high-value sectors and low in low-value sectors. Rather, size-adjusted prices and values are close only in the sense that almost all sectors’ prices are close to almost all sectors’ values. I thus find that, on average, a sector’s value is no better a predictor of its price than is a random variable with the same probability distribution as the values."""
Kliman also demonstrates that transforming the values in the way they propose (dividing by total cost) would still produce values in line with theory, if the theory were correct: <https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/26/3/299/1711462> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/cje/26.3.299> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787155135120801852/kliman2002.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787168870120423444/unknown.png """Table 2 also shows that the simulations closely mirror theoretical expectations. This is important to emphasise because it has been suggested (OPE-L Archives, Feb.–Mar., 1999; see esp. posts 439, 443, 457 and 476) that deflation of prices and values by costs destroys a valid relationship between them. The source of the problem is supposedly that costs and values are too highly correlated. Yet although the simulations assumed value– cost correlations almost identical to the actual ones, they yielded average values for the intercept and slope terms extremely close to those predicted by theory, as well as small standard deviations. This again demonstrates that, if the labour theory of relative prices were true, the price–value relationship would be preserved under transformation."""
^ Zachariah response suggests that industry size deflation is wrong -- but presents no argumentation as to why: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/787159590440796170/zachariah2006.pdf> """Hence it would be inappropriate to deflate industry outputs by size, as suggested in Kliman [10, sec. 4], in order to address any spurious correlation arising from aggregation. This should rather be done by using less aggregated data or comparing results to alternative predictors as in section 4.3."""

Mohun 2014 preprint: ~2% of the US population are 'capitalists' and could subside on capital gains alone; the portion of capitalists and the portion of income going to capitalists both decreased until the 1970's and increased afterwards: <https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/classstructure1918to2011wmf.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/540356346176864295/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/981789150061666374/unknown.png """Suppose the capitalist-managerial class were defined as that group that has suffcient assets to generate a nonlabour income on which a typical member could survive without having to enter the labour market. This is independent of whether they choose to enter it (although the PS data show that on average they do so enter it); because of their level of nonlabour income, they are genuinely free to choose whether or not to take employment. Call this capitalist-managerial class "quasi-capitalist managers" or "Qc managersí for short." Managers who are in a structurally different position, being forced to sell their labour-power, are noncapitalist-managers. Still managers, with supervisory responsibilities in production, they are not free to choose whether or not to take employment, because they do not have sufficient assets to generate a nonlabour income enabling them not to enter the labour market. Hence call them "labour-power dependent managers" or "Lpd managers" for short."""

# marx quotes on "functioning capitalists" (owner-managers) declining and money-capitalists (owners) emerging
Marx 1894: manager-capitalists are akin to orchestra managers -- they need not pay their players, the theater owner does: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch23.htm> """The capitalist mode of production has brought matters to a point where the work of supervision, entirely divorced from the ownership of capital, is always readily obtainable. It has, therefore, come to be useless for the capitalist to perform it himself. **An orchestra conductor need not own the instruments of his orchestra, nor is it within the scope of his duties as conductor to have anything to do with the "wages" of the other musicians.**"""
Marx 1894: the rise of publicly-traded companies has eliminated the need for direct manager-capitalist owners: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch23.htm> """The wages of management both for the commercial and industrial manager are completely isolated from the profits of enterprise in the co-operative factories of labourers, as well as in capitalist stock companies. [....] Stock companies in general — developed with the credit system — have an increasing tendency to separate this work of management as a function from the ownership of capital, be it self-owned or borrowed. Just as the development of bourgeois society witnessed a separation of the functions of judges and administrators from land-ownership, whose attributes they were in feudal times. But since, on the one hand, the mere owner of capital, the money-capitalist, has to face the functioning capitalist, while money-capital itself assumes a social character with the advance of credit, being concentrated in banks and loaned out by them instead of its original owners, and since, on the other hand, **the mere manager who has no title whatever to the capital, whether through borrowing it or otherwise, performs all the real functions pertaining to the functioning capitalist as such, only the functionary remains and the capitalist disappears as superfluous from the production process.**"""
Marx 1894: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch27.htm> """III. Formation of stock companies. Thereby: [....] Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere manager, administrator of other people's capital, and of the owner of capital into a mere owner, a mere money-capitalist. Even if the dividends which they receive include the interest and the profit of enterprise, i.e., the total profit (for the salary of the manager is, or should be, simply the wage of a specific type of skilled labour, whose price is regulated in the labour-market like that of any other labour), this total profit is henceforth received only in the form of interest, i.e., as mere compensation for owning capital that now is entirely divorced from the function in the actual process of reproduction, just as this function in the person of the manager is divorced from ownership of capital.""" """In stock companies the function is divorced from capital ownership, hence also labour is entirely divorced from ownership of means of production and surplus-labour. This result of the ultimate development of capitalist production is a necessary transitional phase towards the reconversion of capital into the property of producers, although no longer as the private property of the individual producers, but rather as the property of associated producers, as outright social property. On the other hand, the stock company is a transition toward the conversion of all functions in the reproduction process which still remain linked with capitalist property, into mere functions of associated producers, into social functions."""

Engels 1884: the state arose to control class divisions; as class divisions disappear, we will "put the whole state machinery" into "the museum of antiquities, next to the spinning wheel and the bronze axe": <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/ch09.htm> <https://u1lib.org/book/2484974/38c451> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/886841633033818112/mecw26.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/887028460776730714/unknown.png """The state, therefore, has not existed from all eternity. There have been societies which have managed without it, which had no notion of the state or state power. At a definite stage of economic development, which necessarily involved the cleavage of society into classes, the state became a necessity because of this cleavage. We are now rapidly approaching a stage in the development of production at which the existence of these classes has not only ceased to be a necessity, but becomes a positive hindrance to production. They will fall as inevitably as they once arose. The state inevitably falls with them. The society which organizes production anew on the basis of free and equal association of the producers will put the whole state machinery where it will then belong – into the museum of antiquities, next to the spinning wheel and the bronze ax."""

Marx 1859: mankind proceeds through "Asiatic", "ancient", "feudal", and "bourgeois" epochs of modes of production: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm> """Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient,[A] feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production – antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence – but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation."""

Both suggestions leave much to be desired. The former contends that Marx’s ethics are ultimately personal and arbitrary, even though, throughout his life, Marx emphasised the social dimensions of life, and argued that communism would be founded upon a rational, non-arbitrary, basis. The latter leaves us wondering why, if it was bound to come, Marx worked for that moral future. Indeed, how could he — as he did — condemn some of those things which came to pass within his own lifetime?

Secondly, it is often noted that Marx was not, as one would expect a scientist to be, a neutral, dispassionate observer in his writings. This is as evident in his writings on political economy as it is in his newspaper articles. In Capital, for example, he condemns the egoism, exploitation, estrangement, degradation, etc. which capitalism brings in its train. Marx’s writings are pervaded by a normative and partisan atmosphere. His commitment to the particular kind of social order which he sees his work as advancing is always obvious and constantly present. Further, this commitment is not simply a personal commitment, but one which he clearly believes that others should share. Finally, if Marx were a scientist without an ethics, it is unclear how we are to understand his many comments that communism will constitute a ‘higher’ plane of existence for humanity, that there is a ‘progressive’ nature to history, and that communism will institute a ‘true realm’ of freedom."""

[....] I do not maintain that Marx formulated a moral theory in a manner comparable to the moral theories which past or present moral philosophers have formulated. Marx did not write a treatise, any pamphlets, or even any essays on ethics and morality. At the most we have various sections in larger works, paragraphs, and scattered comments on ethics and morality which are interwoven with his reflections on history, economics, and politics. Further, on those occasions on which he does speak of ethics he does not engage in moral reflection as traditional and contemporary moral philosophers have. He does not pose for himself the question, ‘What ought I to do?’ as a way of entering into moral reflection. He does not set out, as Kant and others have, to search for and establish the supreme principle of morality by argument and consideration of the reasons and views of others. Thus, he does not, in any obvious way, urge the universalisation of the maxims of our actions (as Kant did) or the calculation of the greatest good our actions might promote (as J.S. Mill did). Such individual questions are quite secondary to Marx’s concern for the social system within which people raise such questions. Nor does Marx attempt to develop a theory of the meaning and purpose of moral statements as individuals make them. As such, Marx was not a moral philosopher. There are few, I think, who would deny this. However, it does not follow that Marx did not have a moral theory. A person may be said to have a moral theory, even though he may never have explicitly formulated it.

(The italicized thesis is misreported, in two different ways, at pp. 9 and 42 of Marx and Morality (op. cit.) because of bad (copy?) editing.) At one point Wood approaches a thesis about Marx on capitalism and justice which resembles the one just stated, but he retreats from it on the ground that 'there is no sign that Marx sees anything morally wrong or unjust about . . . capitalism' (p.

As opposed to the moral philosophers and moralists of his time, Marx insisted that any creditable critical theory of man and society must clearly distinguish between appearance and reality. It must relentlessly pursue and analyse ‘the common wisdom’ for the realities it conceals. Furthermore, such an account must show how human society really operates, how it can be and must be changed.

The first is, that in all countries, during the time from 1815 to 1830, the essentially democratic movement of the working classes was more or less made subservient to the liberal movement of the bourgeois. The working people, though more advanced than the middle classes, could not yet see the total difference between liberalism and democracy — emancipation of the middle classes and emancipation of the working classes; they could not see the difference between liberty of money and liberty of man, until money had been made politically free, until the middle class had been made the exclusively ruling class."""

But in consequence of the objective laws of existing society, one and the other develop in a precisely opposite direction. The process of production is increasingly socialised, and State intervention, the control of the State over the process of production, is extended. But at the same time, private property becomes more and more the form of open capitalist exploitation of the labour of others, and State control is penetrated with the exclusive interests of the ruling class. The State, that is to say the political organisation of capitalism, and the property relations, that is to say the juridical organisation of capitalism, become more capitalist and not more socialist, opposing to the theory of the progressive introduction of socialism two insurmountable difficulties. Fourier’s scheme of changing, by means of a system of phalansteries, the water of all the seas into tasty lemonade was surely a fantastic idea. But Bernstein, proposing to change the sea of capitalist bitterness into a sea of socialist sweetness, by progressively pouring into it bottles of social reformist lemonade, presents an idea that is merely more insipid but no less fantastic. The production relations of capitalist society approach more and more the production relations of socialist society. But on the other hand, its political and juridical relations established between capitalist society and socialist society a steadily rising wall. This wall is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened and consolidated by the development of social reforms and the course of democracy. Only the hammer blow of revolution, that is to day, the conquest of political power by the proletariat can break down this wall."""

According to the present conception of the party, trade-union and parliamentary activity are important for the socialist movement because such activity prepares the proletariat, that is to say, creates the subjective factor of the socialist transformation, for the task of realising socialism. But according to Bernstein, trade-unions and parliamentary activity gradually reduce capitalist exploitation itself. They remove from capitalist society its capitalist character. They realise objectively the desired social change. Examining the matter closely, we see that the two conceptions are diametrically opposed. Viewing the situation from the current standpoint of our party, we say that as a result of its trade union and parliamentary struggles, the proletariat becomes convinced, of the impossibility of accomplishing a fundamental social change through such activity and arrives at the understanding that the conquest of power is unavoidable. Bernstein’s theory, however, begins by declaring that this conquest is impossible. It concludes by affirming that socialism can only be introduced as a result of the trade-union struggle and parliamentary activity. For as seen by Bernstein, trade union and parliamentary action has a socialist character because it exercises a progressively socialising influence on capitalist economy. We tried to show that this influence is purely imaginary. The relations between capitalist property and the capitalist State develop in entirely opposite directions, so that the daily practical activity of the present Social Democracy loses, in the last analysis, all connection with work for socialism."""

At the heart of this transformation lies a paradox. Democracy introduces equality into societies riven by class and status hierarchy. To our ancestors, there would have been nothing stranger than learning that kings and lords would soon cede power to their serfs. Yet, steadily, our unequal world democratized. Our best indicators record extraordinary progress since the French Revolution.""""""These authors are right to assume that democratization is a contest between contending classes. Yet they have mostly misunderstood the character of this contest — specifically, the conditions under which the poor win democracy from the rich. The leverage of the poor comes not from growing wealth (as Ben Ansell and David Samuels argue) or from the threat of an unexpected rebellion (as Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson or Carles Boix claim). Rather, their leverage is the result of economic developments that give the poor the capacity to challenge the routines on which elites depend for their wealth.""""""The most consistent, powerful explanations for the rise of democracy are these two: the growth of the disruptive capacities of ordinary people and the death of the landlord class.""""""For instance, one of the major ways in which power has been redistributed in modern societies is via the growth of the welfare state. A long line of social science research suggests that the rise of this redistribution from rich to poor is in large part due to the labor movement and the social-democratic parties to which it has given rise. And in recent work studying the evolution of political power more specifically, Mohammad Ali Kadivar, Benjamin Bradlow, and I find that more mobilization leads to more participatory, egalitarian, and deliberative democracies.""""""In any society riven by inequalities of income and wealth, democratization is reduced to the formidable task of bending the powerful to the public interest. Liberal common sense has obscured this, to the detriment of democracy. Liberals are fond of attributing the present-day woes of democracy to the rise of new media or particularly able demagogues.

We do not find an effect of the left–right position of the main center right competitor on social democratic support. We replicated this analysis breaking the left–right down into separate economic and social dimensions—see Appendix Table A6—and we found that social democratic parties won more votes when they were more free market on the economic dimension but more conservative on the social dimension. These results challenge some existing research, for example, that there is little evidence of the link between parties’ positions and their electoral performance (e.g., Adams 2012) and Kitschelt ’s (1990) contention that social democrats should gain support as they become leftlibertarian. However, further investigation reveals that this result on the social dimension is mainly driven by parties in Central and Eastern Europe (after 1989), where several parties, in Romania and Slovakia for example, became socially conservative from the early 2000s and gained votes at the expense of more liberalcosmopolitan parties. In contrast, there is little evidence in Western Europe of a connection between social democratic parties’ positions on a social dimension and their electoral performance.""" light red dotted line is the most useful one

While they benefit from centripetal movements on economic-related issues, they suffer electorally if they pursue the same strategy on non-economic issues. These different effects can be explained if the perspective of issue competition is taken into account. Since RLPs have built a stable party-issue linkage in the economic realm, they benefit from moderating their stances on these issues with the goal of attracting social democratic voters. Concerning non-economic issues, they compete with other leftist and libertarian parties for a credible party-issue linkage in the voters’ minds. For that reason, they are punished at the polls if they promote moderate stances that fail to present clearly distinguishable programmatic alternatives. The effect of these strategic considerations varies partly with the positioning of mainstream left parties. In contrast to the widely assumed effect of accommodative mainstream party behaviour (Meguid 2008), more moderate positions of social democratic parties decrease the marginal effect of RLPs’ positional strategies on the economic dimension. If the mainstream left takes a noncentrist stance, they seem to legitimise leftist ideas on the economy and thus foster the positive effect of RLPs’ positional shifts. Hence, far-left challengers profit electorally if mainstream parties politicise their core issues and signal their relevance to the electorate. Considering the non-economic dimension, this effect could not be observed. Here, RLPs are punished electorally if they moderate their policy stance. This is true independent of the positional strategy put forward by mainstream parties. RLPs are thus best advised to promote an outsider profile on this issue dimension."""

I think we have to operate on this assumption, if we understand what is going on, and it is irresponsible to throw about the concept of revolution or revolutionary for the protest movement we have today."""
Marcuse 1968: the anti-police barricades, seizing of buildings, and protests first by students then by workers should make clear that students and intellectuals can help to lead radical socialist acitivity from the workers by leading by example: <https://jacobin.com/2021/03/herbert-marcuse-student-revolts-of-1968-ucsd-lecture> <http://web.archive.org/web/20220630232408/https://jacobin.com/2021/03/herbert-marcuse-student-revolts-of-1968-ucsd-lecture> """In the first place, it should once and for all heal whoever still suffers from the inferiority complex of the intellectual. There isn’t the slightest doubt that, in this case, the students showed the workers what could be done, and that the workers followed the slogan and the example set by the students. The students were literally the avant-garde — not of a revolution, because it isn’t a revolution, but the avant-garde of an action which indeed turned spontaneously into a mass action. That is here in my view the decisive point."""
Marcuse 1968: France suggests a different model of revolution; spontaneity is key, rather than simply seizing the capitol, which has no great importance: <https://jacobin.com/2021/03/herbert-marcuse-student-revolts-of-1968-ucsd-lecture> <http://web.archive.org/web/20220630232408/https://jacobin.com/2021/03/herbert-marcuse-student-revolts-of-1968-ucsd-lecture> """I think [there is] one thing we can say safely: that the traditional idea of the revolution, and the traditional strategy of the revolution are out. They are outdated, they are simply surpassed by the development of our society. I said [this] before, and I’d like to repeat it — because I think in this situation nothing is more seriously required than a sober mind: the idea that one day or one night, [a] mass organization or mass party or masses of whatever kind march on Washington and occupy the Pentagon and the White House and set up a government is, I think, utterly fantastic, and simply in no way corresponds to the reality of things. If there ever would be such masses and this would happen, within twenty-four hours, another White House would have been set up in Texas or in North Dakota, and the whole thing would quickly come to an end. We have to forget this idea of the revolution, and that is why I believe that what is taking place in France today is so significant and may well be decisive, and that is exactly why I stress the spontaneous character of this movement and the spontaneous way in which it spread."""

There is then a conflict with the pre-existing power structure and the result of that clash determines the success or failure of the revolution. No such alternative appeared in France. No sizeable political party or movement or combination encouraged the appearance of an alternative power structure and in the absence of that, the workers themselves did not rise to the occasion."""
"""The workplace democracy was in fact very limited. In only about a fifth of workplaces did a general assembly involving all the workers make decisions and in only about a seventh were the strike committees actually elected by the strikers.

Violent tactics include bombings, shootings, kidnappings, physical sabotage such as the destruction of infrastructure, and other types of physical harm of people and property.

For our study, to be considered a “success” a campaign had to meet two conditions: the full achievement of its stated goals (regime change, antioccupation, or secession) within a year of the peak of activities and a discernible effect on the outcome, such that the outcome was a direct result of the campaign’s activities (Pape 1997). The second qualification is important because in some cases the desired outcome occurred mainly because of other conditions. The Greek resistance against the Nazi occupation, for example, is not coded as a full success even though the Nazis ultimately withdrew from Greece. Although effective in many respects, the Greek resistance alone cannot be credited with the ultimate outcome of the end of Nazi influence over Greece since the Nazi withdrawal was the result of the Allied victory rather than solely Greek resistance."""

Campaigns have discernible leadership and often have names, distinguishing them from random riots or spontaneous mass acts. 14 Usually campaigns have distinguishable beginning and end points, as well as discernible events throughout the campaign. In the case of resistance campaigns, beginning and end points are difficult to determine, as are the events throughout the campaign. In some cases, information on such events is readily available (e.g., Northern Ireland from 1969 to 1999); however, in most cases, it is not.

In general, the 2SLS coefficients and their standard errors are larger in magnitude than in the OLS analogues. The 2SLS coefficients are uniformly negative, economically large, and remain near conventional levels of statistical significance. Given the relatively large standard errors, it is not surprising that Durbin-WuHausman tests cannot decisively reject the exogeneity of the severity variable, but the test statistics are large enough (p-values of 0.14 for 1960-70 and 0.27 for 1960-80) that we are reluctant to ignore the 2SLS suggestion that the true effects are larger than the OLS estimates."""

Burnout refers to dissidents becoming tired of the stresses of being involved in a movement causing disengagement. Factionalization occurs when differences in opinion arise either ideologically or tactically causing a schism in the group. If suffering from lost commitment a social movement organization (SMO) participant loses their emotional attachment to the movement in question. Membership loss refers to the mechanical functioning of an SMO and the amount of people it will take to accomplish the goals of the organization. Finally, if a movement places too much power into the hands of only a few inflexible leaders the organization may not be able to react to change. This is referred to as rigidity.26 Davenport also identifies three ways that SMOs are challenged from the outside: resource deprivation, problem depletion, and state repression. SMOs need resources to thrive (or survive), but these resources often come from external sources. If these sources are cut off or become suddenly unsympathetic to the cause, resource deprivation is likely to occur. Problem depletion occurs when constituents perceive an improvement in the situation that the SMO is challenging. In this situation a government (or other institution) may make reforms (whether real or perceived) that are perceived to be a positive change. Finally, state"""

Goldman 1931: often wrongly quoted as "If I can't dance, it's not my revolution!" or "A revolution without dancing is not a revolution worth having": <https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Emma_Goldman> """At the dances I was one of the most untiring and gayest. One evening a cousin of Sasha, a young boy, took me aside. With a grave face, as if he were about to announce the death of a dear comrade, he whispered to me that it did not behoove an agitator to dance. Certainly not with such reckless abandon, anyway. It was undignified for one who was on the way to become a force in the anarchist movement. My frivolity would only hurt the Cause. I grew furious at the impudent interference of the boy. I told him to mind his own business. I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown into my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from convention and prejudice, should demand the denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to become a nun and that the movement would not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things." Anarchism meant that to me, and I would live it in spite of the whole world — prisons, persecution, everything. Yes, even in spite of the condemnation of my own closest comrades I would live my beautiful ideal."""

Dobrenko 1997 [trans Savage 1997]: mid-1925's metalworkers worker mostly read fiction in one large union library (5300 of 7300 books were belles-lettres): <https://www.worldcat.org/title/231727062> <http://library.lol/main/C933C02DE8E7863F96E9943B8F25BED8> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1082782328440492142/dobrenko1997.pdf> """But what did the worker in the mid-1920s read? Let us examine the data from a study of the factory-worker readers of the Kolomna suburb of Moscow. The Kolomna metalworks housed a library of about 10,000 books, which were read by 1,703 adult workers. The data of the Kolomna study in 1925 are interesting for their "purity," for there was a "natural selection" here: the factory library was not used by the city readers and students who had always constituted a significant part of library visitors. So it is worth noting first of all the predominant interest in belles lettres: out of 7,260 books checked out in one month, 5,317 were belles-lettres titles. Among these, the most widely read were by the authors Dem'ian Bednyi and A. Novikov-Priboi; translated literature was read mostly by the factory intelligentsia. Older workers and girls had a negative attitude toward new literature. Classic literature was read mostly by workers 50 years old and older (among whom author Aleksei Pisemskii enjoyed the greatest popularity), although young workers tended toward the classics as well (one of them demanded, "Give me some Lermontov"). For girls, the novels of A. ShellerMikhailov were in constant demand. There was steady interest in Jack London and Upton Sinclair, and in Emile Zola's social novels. Among the Russian classics, first place went to Tolstoy, followed by Turgenev and Dostoyevsky. Among contemporary writers, the greatest demand was for Gorky and for Aleksandr Serafimovich (pseudonym of A. Popov), and in "new literature" (in order of decreasing demand), for Aleksandr Neverov, Lidia Seifullina, lurii Libedinskii, Vsevolod Ivanov, Leonid Leonov, Dmitrii Furmanov, Fedor Gladkov, and Nikolai Liashko. The library's copies of books by Konstantin Fedin and Aleksandr Arosev were little read. Il'ia Erenburg was read by both male and female workers (the latter especially read The Love ofZhanna Nei [Liubov Zhanny Net]). Among the poets, Aleksei Nekrasov and Ivan Nikitin were read, as were the contemporary poets Sergei Esenin, Aleksandr Bezymenskii, Mayakovsky, Aleksandr Zharov, and Ivan Doronin. The study showed that the factory's youth read little, especially the Komsomol activists.7"""

This very low percentage was explained in a peculiar way: "The percentage of sociopolitical literature that our people are reading is extremely low, and this forces us to sound an alarm. It would be a malicious calumny of workers if people could think the working-class reader does not want to read these books. The fact is that we do not offer him this literature as we should, and this is the fundamental problem."18"""

The same evidence can suggest why nearly a third of that total was represented by foreign authors and also why the most frequently translated American authors are nineteenth or early twentietlh century writers. The modern Russian reader is old-fashioned in his taste. He clings to the past, whether it be the Russian past or the past of the world outside. To a much lesser degree, he is interested in the world of the future, represented largely by science fiction.""""""Heavy emphasis, in the American books known to Russians, is placed on stories of frontier life (e.g., London, Cooper, Norris, and the children's writer James Willard Schultz, the latter published in 625,000 copies in the past ten years). Russian readers may find in these books a sympathetic interest since Russia, too, has had an untamed wvilderness to conquer. More probably, they enjoy them as purely escapist literature. Particular Russian interest is noticeable also in science fiction. though it is most evident in the wide publication of a nineteenth century French writer, Jules Verne. Apparently the only American writer of this genre published in the USSR is Ray Bradbury, althiough Mitchell Wilson's novels about scientists (Live with Lightning and My Brother, Mlly Enemy) might be considered distant cousins of science fiction. Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury's most frequently published title in the USSR, is so much concerned with a regimented society that it is almost a social tract, and therefore should perhaps be classified as political rather than science fiction. Nevertheless, American science fiction, like frontier literature, probably strikes a sympathetichord with Russians. Also, like frontier and Indian tales, it provides a release from reality."""

In the most advanced land of capitalism and political liberty, the British bourgeoisie (who as far back as the seventeenth century settled accounts with the absolute monarchy in a rather democratic way) managed in the nineteenth century to split the British working-class movement. In the middle of the nineteenth century Britain enjoyed an almost complete monopoly in the world market. Thanks to this monopoly the profits acquired by British capital were extraordinarily high, so that it was possible for some crumbs of these profits to be thrown to the aristocracy of labour, the skilled factory workers. This aristocracy of labour, which at that time earned tolerably good wages, boxed itself up in narrow, self-interested craft unions, and isolated itself from the mass of the proletariat, while in politics it supported the liberal bourgeoisie. And to this very day perhaps nowhere in the world are there so many liberals among the advanced workers as in Britain."""

Adjusted by this figure, which represents a coefficient for the real value of goods exports to the OECD from the non-OECD countries under conditions of equal exchange (equal international distribution of value added according to equivalent productivity) and where the overall price stays the same, nonOECD goods exports should have been worth approximately US$6.24 trillion. Since only US$5.2 trillion was paid for these goods, unrequited value worth over US$1 trillion was transferred from the non-OECD goods exports sector by the OECD in 2012. If OECD goods exports to the non-OECD were overvalued by the same proportion, then OECD merchandise exports to the non-OECD should only have been worth around (US$2.5 trillion/ 1.2) US$2 trillion. Since US$2.5 trillion was actually paid for these goods, unrequited value worth US$500 billion was transferred from the non-OECD goods export sector by the OECD in 2012.

For both liberals and Eurocentric Marxists, global wage differentials are the mechanical effect of productivity differentials resulting from differences in the level of countries’ productive forces (these conceived as ineluctably national in origin). By contrast, we argue that although the uneven and dependent development of the productive forces in Third-World countries conditions the value of labour-power (Amin 1977: 194), as Marx (1977/1867: 53) argued, an hour of average socially necessary labour always yields an equal amount of value independently of variations in physical productivity, hence the tendency for labour-saving technological change to depress the rate of profit. Although increased productivity results in the creation of more use values per unit of time, only the intensified consumption of labour power can generate added (exchange) value. Since wages are not the price for the result of labour but the price for labour power, higher wages are not the consequence of (short-term) productivity gains accruing to capital.""""""As Jedlicki (2007) argues, value-added figures already incorporate those wage and capital differentials which Western socialists justify in the name of superior First-World productivity.

Following and studying the best practices of previous truth commissions in Chile and Argentina, but particularly in South Africa and Guatemala, the Peruvian CVR set new standards for this kind of project, which later infl uenced similar commissions in other parts of the world (Hayner 2011; Landman 2006). The CVR presented an alternative narrative of the confl ict that challenged the “victorious” version of the Fujimori regime and the military as defeating Sendero Luminoso and pacifying the country. It also presented strong evidence that portrayed Sendero Luminoso as the main perpetrator of deadly violence during the confl ict, in sharp contrast with other confl icts in Latin America. The CVR provided the human rights movements and the victims with important tools (legitimacy, data, forensic evidence, recommendations concerning reparations, etc.) to advance their claims for justice and reparations from the state and the judiciary system. However, as in the cases of other truth commissions (Hayner 2011; Bakiner 2016; Landman 2006), the role of the CVR is still a matter of controversy.

The support was neither capricious nor unreasonable; it was rooted in profound and widespread fear (Schulte-Bockholt 2013, 97). The fear was not limited to the business community and the armed forces. It extended to virtually the entire middle class as well as working- class and poor rural communities, which felt the brunt of the confl ict.

Secondly, since from the 1840s Marx noted and applauded the potential of the 'Social Democratic' route, at least under the appropriate conditions - including national character - Engels was scarcely deviating from the master and certainly not belatedly so. Indeed, some of Marx's affirmations are quite as strong as those of Engels in 1895."""
Hollander 2010: however, Marx and Engels held that parliamentary victory should be followed by pursuing Communist goals, preparing a dictatorship of the proletariat in law and force, and therefore preventing the removal of the party from government: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/41802465> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.2307/41802465> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865759002133397544/hollander2010.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/865760822017523793/unknown.png """[T]here are certainly limits to Engels' revisionism. Thus it is misleading to speak of his having in 1895 'fully accepted the democratic viewpoint', since the parliamentary route was only the most effective means - and only under certain conditions - of assuring a 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. And most important, the immediate goal of a parliamentary majority was to establish, or at least set the foundations for, a classless communist system, on which matter there was no compromise; thus Engels would have found unacceptable a Parliamentary system generating a working-class majority unwilling to carry out a Communist program - Engels' support for Universal Suffrage as means to achieve proletarian power presupposes that elected workers tow the party line - or a working-class electorate choosing to replace the party at the polls. Such outcomes would render the 'dictatorship' a contradiction in terms.

It's slower and more boring than the call to revolution, but it's ten times more sure, and what is even better, it indicates with the most perfect accuracy the day when a call to armed revolution has to be made; it's even ten to one that universal suffrage, intelligently used by the workers, will drive the rulers to overthrow legality, that is, to put us in the most favorable position to make the revolution. 40 Engels, therefore, leaves no doubt, contrary to all of the social democratic efforts to make him a reformist, that elections under capitalism were only a means, a "gauge," the best in his opinion, to determine when to resort to armed struggle.41 And this was a gauge to be employed not just in Bismarck's Germany."""

[and] the way our workers have run the affair, the tenacity, determination and above all, humour with which they have captured position after position and set at naught all the dodges, threats and bullying on the part of the government and bourgeoisie."42 In other words, the self­organization of the working class was the decisive gain. Or, to Sorge about the successes in the 1887 elections: "It is not at all a question of the number of seats, but solely of the statistical record of the irresistible growth of the party."43 And finally, the 1893 elections: "[T] he number of seats is a very secondary consideration. The principal one is the increase of votes . . . [especially in the] rural districts . . . without which we cannot expect to be victorious."44 Although the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands or SPD, the new name the party adopted after the ban was lifted in 1890, didn't do as well in the runoff elections in terms of seats, Engels said, "I am prouder of the defeats than of the successes . . . [because] What we won we owe—for the first time—entirely to our own strength . . .

On the contrary, I have expressly said," echoing his aforementioned comments to LaFargue, "that the odds are ten to one that our rulers, well before that point arrives, will use violence against us, and this would shift us from the terrain of majority to the terrain of revolution."49"""

And so it came about that bourgeoisie and Government feared far more the legal than the illegal action of the workers’ party, more the successes of the elections than those of rebellion."""

The barricade had lost its charm; the soldier saw behind it no longer “the people,” but rebels, agitators, plunderers, dividers, the dregs of society; the officer had in the course of time become familiar with the tactical forms of the street battle; no longer did he march in direct line and without cover upon the improvised breastworks, but outflanked them through gardens, courts and houses; and that succeeded now with some skill in nine cases out of ten."""

He kept close to known facts and his propositions derive from them. That is why historians, and especially economic historians, take his analysis very seriously indeed. Many disagree with him, but where they present well-argued accounts of the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath which differ from the Marxist one, they have to present a documented case against the Marxist interpretation of these events.21 Marxist history and Marxist economic history is now very much part of the mainstream of scholarship. In contrast, Marx's analysis of the laws which influence the development of economies receives little or no attention from economists. They have appeared a complete irrelevance to most because they are so much at variance with what has happened since 1867. Are economists in fact right to pay such scant regard to the economics of Capital? Marx predicted deepening crises and a declining rate or profit. Are there not deepening crises, and is not the rate of profit falling? [1] The crises, in so far as their explanation is Keynesian, depend on repeated failures of effective demand to keep pace with the growth of productive capacity. Marx called such difficulties a failure to realise surplus-value, and he said a little about the nature and implications of the realisation problem. Keynes and the economists who followed him have set all this out in very great detail, and with a rigour which Marx never attempted.22 What he said about the realisation problem (which echoes the previous analyses of Quesnay and Malthus) will seem wholly sensible to many today, but there is not very much of it. This was not an element of Capital which he worked through fully and completely, and what he had to say made little impact until Keynes rediscovered the same lines of argument, and set them out in a way which convinced his contemporaries.

As was argued in Chapter 7, at the time that Marx wrote, capitalists could pass and enforce legislation to limit the power and indeed the very existence of trade unions. At the same time there were few laws to limit or constrain the profit maximising behaviour of capitalists: just a few which were passed with great difficulty to limit the hours of employment of women and children. Employers were wholly free to combine, without government attempts to control them, to fix prices in relation to wages and to limit wages, and they could dismiss workers at will and without compensation. In the absence of welfare provision for the unemployed, mere survival dictated that workers sell their labour-power on the best terms they could get. Many capitalists, in contrast, could survive financially without workers for months or even years.

Such laws as exist to limit the exercise of union power are, in contrast, often not enforced because governments believe that they cannot or should not use a degree of force against strikers which would have been imposed as a matter of course (to contain riots) in the nineteenth century. Still more fundamentally, welfare provisions are such that it is an open question whether workers can live without companies for longer than companies can survive without workers. Capital therefore now lacks the power to coerce labour. Someone who has learned from Marx would say, and rightly, that these changes are partly due to an increase in the power of the working class and a decline in the power of the capitalist class. The rate of exploitation has in consequence fallen, which has raised the share of wages and salaries in the national income and reduced the share of profits - and indeed the rate of profit."""

An economist who has learned nothing from Marx can all too easily fall into the trap of attempting to explain changes in income distribution by assuming a theoretical world where there is no institutional change, and where workers and those who control corporations are equally free to act to maximise their utilities in an unchanging legal and institutional environment. Marx provided a richer analysis. His predictions about the nature and direction of technical change and what followed from this may have been quite largely mistaken, but his attempt to explain income distribution as a consequence of relative class power will always deserve close attention."""

# theory of accumulation was common: see eg keynes on overaccumulation
John Maynard Keynes, 1936 General Theory of Employment, lnterest and Money, pp. 1 29-1 3 l: When involuntary unemployment exists, the marginal disutility of labour is necessarily less than the utility of the marginal product. [ ... ] Pyramid-building, earthquakes, even wars may serve to increase wealth, if the education of our slatesmen on the principles of the classical economics stands in the way of anything better. [ ... ]Just as wars have been the only form of large-scale loan expenditure which statesmen have thought justifiable, so gold-mining is the only pretext for digging holes in the ground which has recommended itself to bankers as sound finance; and each of these activities has played its part in progress - failing something better. Ancient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth, in that it possessed two aclivities, namely pyramid-building as weil as the search for precious metals, the fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being consumed, did not stale with abundance.

Yet this argument does not lead anywhere. As soon as this final result is achieved — in theory, of course, because it can never actually happen — accumulation must come to a stop. The realisation and capitalisation of surplus value become impossible to accomplish. Just as soon as reality begins to correspond to Marx’s diagram of enlarged reproduction, the end of accumulation is in sight, it has reached its limits, and capitalist production is in extremis.

The more ruthless1y capital uses militarism to put an end to noncapitalist strata in the outside world and at home, the more it depresses the conditions of existence of all working strata, the more the day-today history of capital accumulation on the world stage changes into an endless chain of political and social catastrophes and convulsions; these latter, together with the periodic economic catastrophes in the shape of crises, make continued accumulation impossible and the rebellion of the international working class against the rule of capital necessary, even before it has economically reached the limits it set for itself."""

# failure of luxemburgian catastrophism: overaccumulation model itself

[Luxemburg] then sets out a fresh model allowing for technical progress. The rate of exploitation (the ratio of surplus to wages) is rising, for real wages remain constant while output per man increases. [....] But there is no need to paddle in the arithmetic to find where the difficulty lies. The model is over-determined because of the rule that the increment of capital within each department at the end of a year must equal the saving made within the same department during the year. If capitalists from Department II [produces consumption goods] were permitted to lend part of their savings to Department I [produces capital, "means of production"] to be invested in its capital, a breakdown would no longer be inevitable. Suppose that total real wages are constant and that real consumption by capitalists increases slowly, so that the real output of Department II rises at a slower rate than productivity, then the amount of labour employed in it is shrinking. The ratio of capital to labour however is rising as a consequence of capital-using technical progress. The output of Department I, and its productive capacity, is growing through time. Capital invested in Department I is accumulating faster than the saving of the capitalists in Department I, and capitalists of Department II, who have no profitable outlet in their own industries for their savings, acquire titles to part of the capital in Department I by supplying the difference between investment in Department I and its own saving. For any increase in the stock of capital of both departments taken together, required by technical progress and demand conditions, there is an appropriate amount of saving, and so long as the total accumulation required and total saving fit, there is no breakdown."""

These quantities might conceivably fit, but there is no guarantee that they will. If the ratio of saving which the capitalists (taken together) choose to make exceeds the rate of accumulation dictated by technical progress, the excess savings can only be ‘capitalised’ if there is an outlet for investment outside the system. [....] Once more we can substitute for a supposed logical necessity a plausible hypothesis about the nature of the real case, and so rescue the succeeding argument. If in reality the distribution of income between workers and capitalists, and the propensity to save of capitalists, are such as to require a rate of accumulation which exceeds the rate of increase in the stock of capital appropriate to technical conditions, then there is a chronic excess of the potential supply of real capital over the demand for it and the system must fall into chronic depression."""

Either the socialist transformation is, as was admitted up to now, the consequence of the internal contradictions of capitalism, and with the growth of capitalism will develop its inner contradictions, resulting inevitably, at some point, in its collapse (in that case the “means of adaptation” are ineffective and the theory of collapse is correct); or the “means of adaptation” will really stop the collapse of the capitalist system and thereby enable capitalism to maintain itself by suppressing its own contradictions. In that case socialism ceases to be a historic necessity. It then becomes anything you want to call it, but it is no longer the result of the material development of society."""

The most important objective argument in support of socialist theory breaks down; socialist political action and the ideological import of the proletarian class struggle cease to reflect economic events, and socialism no longer appears an historical necessity.

We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: (1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the “upper classes”, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for “the lower classes not to want” to live in the old   way; it is also necessary that “the upper classes should be unable” to live in the old way; (2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; (3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in “peace time”, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the “upper classes” themselves into independent historical action.

Why was that? It was because it is not every revolutionary situation that gives rise to a revolution; revolution arises only out of a situation in which the above-mentioned objective changes are accompanied by a subjective change, namely, the ability of the revolutionary class to take revolutionary mass action strong enough to break (or dislocate) the old government, which never, not even in a period of crisis, “falls”, if it is not toppled over."""

Although the subjective forces of the revolution in China are now weak, so also are all organizations (organs of political power, armed forces, political parties, etc.) of the reactionary ruling classes, resting as they do on the backward and fragile social and economic structure of China. This helps to explain why revolution cannot break out at once in the countries of Western Europe where, although the subjective forces of revolution are now perhaps somewhat stronger than in China, the forces of the reactionary ruling classes are many times stronger. In China the revolution will undoubtedly move towards a high tide more rapidly, for although the subjective forces of the revolution at present are weak, the forces of the counter-revolution are relatively weak too."""

In the conditions prevailing in China, their growth is not only possible but indeed inevitable, as the May 30th Movement and the Great Revolution which followed have fully proved. When we look at a thing, we must examine its essence and treat its appearance merely as an usher at the threshold, and once we cross the threshold, we must grasp the essence of the thing; this is the only reliable and scientific method of analysis."""

The reason they seize on the appearance and brush aside the essence in their observation of things is that they have not made a scientific analysis of the essence of the overall situation.

Because the reactionary government, though short of provisions and funds, endlessly expands its armies and thus constantly extends the warfare, the masses of soldiers are in a constant state of privation. Because of the growth in government taxation, the rise in rent and interest demanded by the landlords and the daily spread of the disasters of war, there are famine and banditry everywhere and the peasant masses and the urban poor can hardly keep alive. Because the schools have no money, many students fear that their education may be interrupted; because production is backward, many graduates have no hope of employment.

We shall also see that the high tide of revolution against the imperialists, the warlords and the landlords is inevitable, and will come very soon. All China is littered with dry faggots which will soon be aflame. The saying, "A single spark can start a prairie fire", is an apt description of how the current situation will develop.

The bourgeois-democratic revolution which started in Kwangtung Province had gone only halfway when the comprador and landlord classes usurped the leadership and immediately shifted it on to the road of counter-revolution; throughout the country the workers, the peasants, the other sections of the common people, and even the bourgeoisie, have remained under counter-revolutionary rule and obtained not the slightest particle of political or economic emancipation. [....] The contradictions and struggles among the cliques of warlords in China reflect the contradictions and struggles among the imperialist powers. Hence, as long as China is divided among the imperialist powers, the various cliques of warlords cannot under any circumstances come to terms, and whatever compromises they may reach will only be temporary. A temporary compromise today engenders a bigger war tomorrow. The long-term survival inside a country of one or more small areas under Red political power completely encircled by a White regime is a phenomenon that has never occurred anywhere else in the world. There are special reasons for this unusual phenomenon. It can exist and develop only under certain conditions."""

In other words, what social functions will remain in existence there that are analogous to present state functions? This question can only be answered scientifically, and one does not get a flea-hop nearer to the problem by a thousand-fold combination of the word 'people' with the word 'state'. Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Now the program does not deal with this nor with the future state of communist society. Its political demands contain nothing beyond the old democratic litany familiar to all: universal suffrage, direct legislation, popular rights, a people's militia, etc. They are a mere echo of the bourgeois People's party, of the League of Peace and Freedom. They are all demands which, insofar as they are not exaggerated in fantastic presentation, have already been realized. Only the state to which they belong does not lie within the borders of the German Empire, but in Switzerland, the United States, etc. This sort of "state of the future" is a present-day state, although existing outside the "framework" of the German Empire."""

In the state of the future, existing in Switzerland, this demand has been pretty well fulfilled. Income tax presupposes various sources of income of the various social classes, and hence capitalist society. It is, therefore, nothing remarkable that the Liverpool financial reformers — bourgeois headed by Gladstone's brother — are putting forward the same demand as the program."""

Engels on Marx's views on free trade: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1888/free-trade/> """From this point of view, 40 years ago Marx pronounced, in principle, in favor of Free Trade as the more progressive plan, and therefore the plan which would soonest bring capitalist society to that deadlock. But if Marx declared in favor of Free Trade on that ground, is that not a reason for every supporter of the present order of society to declare against Free Trade? If Free Trade is stated to be revolutionary, must not all good citizens vote for Protection as a conservative plan? If a country nowadays accepts Free Trade, it will certainly not do so to please the socialists. It will do so because Free trade has become a necessity for the industrial capitalists. But if it should reject Free Trade and stick to Protection, in order to cheat the socialists out of the expected social catastrophe, that will not hurt the prospects of socialism in the least. Protection is a plan for artificially manufacturing manufacturers, and therefore also a plan for artificially manufacturing wage laborers. You cannot breed the one without breeding the other."""

# summary
During World War 1, most social-democratic parties split into a majority-defencist and minority-internationalist faction. Defencists argued that socdems should support defensive war efforts, but not offensive war efforts, seeking peace through defensive stalemate. (More extreme, social patriots argued that socdems should support all war efforts.) Internationalists argued that socdems should oppose all war efforts, seeking peace through mass strike. (More extreme, defeatists argued that socdems should encourage the defeat of their own country, in order to bring about a civil war that they might win.) Most French and German Social Democrats were defencists. Most Russian Social Democrats were internationalists until 1917, when they favored "revolutionary defencism" (continuing the war to defend the revolution, Mensheviks and SRs) or "revolutionary defeatists" (abandoning the war to start and win a civil war to complete the revolution, Bolsheviks). <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalist%E2%80%93defencist_schism>

The Germans are fighting both the Tsar and the Republicans, the French against German 'imperialism' and for Russian absolutism. But where does the proletarian and democratic interest lie? But if in the present situation neither the criterion of a war of aggression nor that of proletarian interest can give rise to an equally clear and binding conception for the comrades of all countries, there remains a· third possibility for the deciding criterion.

Marx 1894: in cooperatives, management is not antagonistic to labor because all share the profits (not just the capitalist manager): <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch23.htm> """The wages of management both for the commercial and industrial manager are completely isolated from the profits of enterprise in the co-operative factories of labourers, as well as in capitalist stock companies. The separation of wages of management from profits of enterprise, purely accidental at other times, is here constant. **In a co-operative factory the antagonistic nature of the labour of supervision disappears, because the manager is paid by the labourers instead of representing capital counterposed to them.**"""
Marx 1894: supervision of labor by management is necessary under every mode of production (slave, feudal, capitalist), but management is only antagonistic to labor when their goals are antagonistic: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1894-c3/ch23.htm> """On the one hand, **all labour in which many individuals co-operate necessarily requires a commanding will to co-ordinate and unify the process**, and functions which apply not to partial operations but to the total activity of the workshop, much as that of an orchestra conductor. This is a productive job, which must be performed in every combined mode of production. On the other hand — quite apart from any commercial department — **this supervision work necessarily arises in all modes of production based on the antithesis between the labourer, as the direct producer, and the owner of the means of production**. The greater this antagonism, the greater the role played by supervision. Hence it reaches its peak in the slave system."""

A 1% point increase in the share of immigrants in a local labour market of the typical host country decreases wages of the native born by 0.029% (using a weighted average with weights determined by the precision of the estimates) and decreases employment of the native born by 0.011%."""

# employment and wages: single studies
immigration to the US slightly increases wages for natives, slightly decreases wages for low-education natives, and significantly decreases wages for immigrants: <https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article/10/1/152/2182016> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01052.x> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/495037831949975553/m_jeea0152-08.png In the long run, these estimates imply an overall average positive effect of immigration on native wages of about 0.6% and an overall average negative effect on the wages of previous immigrants of about −6%. [....] All in all, one finding seems robust: once imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants is allowed for, over the period 1990–2006 immigration to the United States had at most a modest negative long-run effect on the real wages of the least educated natives. This effect is between −2.1% and +1.7% depending on the chosen nesting structure, with the positive results coming from the nesting structure preferred by the data. Our finding at the national level of a small wage effect of immigration on less-educated natives is in line with the findings identified at the city level.
immigration is a net positive for the economy, but unequally benefits the high-skilled: <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/589756> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1086/589756> The wage effects are sizeable but plausible: a 10 percent increase in the number of low-skilled immigrants in a city reduces the wages of low-skilled natives by 0.6 percent and of low-skilled immigrants by 8 percent (an own-labor demand elasticity of -1.2). My results imply that the low-skilled immigration wave of the 1990s increased the purchasing power of high-skilled workers living in the 25 largest cities by an average of 0.65 percent and decreased the purchasing power of native high school dropouts by an average of 2.66 percent. I conclude that, through lower prices, low-skilled immigration brings positive net benefits to the US economy as a whole, but generates a redistribution of wealth: it reduces the real income of low-skilled natives and increases the real income of high-skilled natives.

about half of illegal immigrants pay taxes, and they pay at rates close to what they would pay if they were legal: <https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/undocumentedtaxes.pdf> Undocumented immigrants currently contribute significantly to state and local taxes, collectively paying an estimated $10.6 billion in 2010 with contributions ranging from less than $2 million in Montana to more than $2.2 billion in California. This means these families are likely paying about 6.4 percent on average of their income in state and local taxes. Allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States legally would increase their state and local tax contributions by an estimated $2 billion a year. Their effective state and local tax rate would also increase to 7 percent on average, which would put their tax contributions more in line with documented taxpayers with similar incomes.

in 2015, refugee crime in Germany increased by just 79% while the number of refugees increased 440%: <http://www.dw.com/en/report-refugee-related-crimes-in-germany-increase-less-than-influx-of-asylum-seekers/a-19053227>

# controlling for age
accounting for age, migrants in Germany had similar suspect rates as Germans: <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-72159-0_26> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/978-3-319-72159-0_26> """If one would attribute the increase in crime that was observed in 2015 entirely to the refugees that entered Germany in this year, this would lead to a rate of suspects per 100.00 (Tatverdächtigenbelastungszahl, TVBZ) of 5800 for this group of refugees. This rate for Germans was 2124. Hence, the rate for refugees would be considerably higher than the rate for the Germans. But if we take a closer look at the rate of Germans aged between 16 and 30 (which is the age group most closely to that of refugees), one comes to another conclusion. Here, the rate for Germans ranges between 4200 and 5800, so absolutely in the range that is calculated (though inadequately) when observing refugees only. If we apply these numbers to those offenses that seem to matter most to the public (such as burglaries and sexual assaults), then the increase of non-German suspects (and especially of refugees) is considerably lower than one would initially have expected."""
police documents reveal that refugees commit less crime than Germans: <https://www.thelocal.de/20151113/police-refugees-commit-less-crimes-than-germans> <https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article148812603/Straftaten-im-sehr-niedrigen-sechsstelligen-Bereich.html>

# scope of crime committed by asylum seekers
in 2015, 1% of police reports are attributed to asylum seekers and 1.8% of the Swedish population were asylum seekers <http://cpsblog.isr.umich.edu/?p=1905> If asylum-seekers are particularly crime-prone, then we would expect to see crime rates in which they are overrepresented relative to how many are living in Sweden. Sweden hosted approximately 180,000 asylum-seekers during this period and the population of Sweden is approximately 10 million. Therefore, asylum-seekers make up approximately 1.8% of the people living in Sweden, while 1% of the police reports filed in STORM were attributed to asylum-seekers.

# rape: police report data
according to police reports data in Sweden, the rape rate hasn't significantly changed between 2008 and 2015 (the rape law was reformed in 2005): <http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/04/19/what-crime-data-from-sweden-can-and-cannot-tell-us/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640936603195539466/Screen-Shot-2017-04-05-at-5.png
according to police reports data in Sweden, the rate of rape has only slightly increased since 2015 (the rape law was reformed in 2005): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkjkU2w6jhw> <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rnn3Ur8ofYRAIlexfvbc_HXaH7kkWczm> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/567774881043841081/unknown.png

# rape: convictions data
the number of convictions for rape has been basically flat since 2005: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden> The number of convictions has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, with approximately 190 convictions on average each year.[9][10] The total number of convictions for rape and aggravated rape in Sweden 2015 was 176.

# sexual assault
Sweden changed its definition of sexual assault in 2005 and in 2013 <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/24/no-sweden-isnt-hiding-an-immigrant-crime-problem-this-is-the-real-story/> <http://archive.is/T5IuS> In Sweden, the legal definition of sexual assault is much broader than it is in the U.S. and even other European countries. While the rate of rape has remained steady in Sweden over the past decade, changes to the legal definition of sexual assault in 2005 and 2013 resulted in increases in reported sexual assault — because more acts now fall within the legal definition and are therefore officially counted. Thus, the standard of accountability has increased.
2005 reform: After, sex with a person in a "helpless state" (e.g. intoxicated, asleep) was sexual assault: <https://www.regeringen.se/49bb66/contentassets/a0f8b372714a4377a1a507e50f0c3666/en-ny-sexualbrottslagstiftning>
2013 reform: Previously, sex with a person in "helpless state" was sexual assault; after, a person in a "particularly vulnerable situation" was sexual assault. <https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/arende/betankande/en-skarpt-sexualbrottslagstiftning_H001JuU20>

# don't cite the swedish crime survey
commonly cited source (Swedish Crime Survey, not police report data): <https://www.bra.se/bra-in-english/home/crime-and-statistics/swedish-crime-survey.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/567778368716668943/unknown.png
why not to use SCS (NTU) data: <http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/04/19/what-crime-data-from-sweden-can-and-cannot-tell-us/> Many people responded to our articles by citing data from the National Crime Survey (NTU) on an increase from 1% to 1.7% in sexual assault. In doing so, they misunderstood the important distinction between sexual offense and rape. While the NTU survey includes a question about rape, it has not released the raw data or discussed the findings. There are two likely reasons for this. First, there are so few cases of rape in the survey data that they cannot confidently make estimates about its occurrence in the population. Second, the authors of the report believe that respondents’ perceptions may not be accurate reflections of the legal distinctions between various categories of sex offenses. While the NTU is not confident in making precise estimates of the occurrence of rape, it does believe the data are sufficient to conclude that the rate of rape and other forms of coercive sexual offenses (“sexuellt tvång”) is higher than data from the police reports indicate. This means that there is underreporting by victims. Unfortunately, we cannot estimate how the probability of a victim reporting a sexual offense event has changed from year to year, and this affects our ability to draw conclusions about trends in the rape data.

# inclusivist founder quotes about "posterity"
John Adams: immigrants must "shed their European skin" (ie, preference for privilegia) for American equal rights: <https://thefederalist.com/2014/08/18/what-john-quincy-adams-said-about-immigration-will-blow-your-mind/> <https://archive.org/stream/nilesweeklyregis18balt#page/157/mode/1up> Emigrants from Germany, therefore, or from elsewhere, coming here, are not to expect favors from the governments. They are to expect, if they choose to become citizens, equal rights with those of the natives of the country. They are to expect, if affluent, to possess the means of making their property productive, with moderation, and with safety;—if indigent, but industrious, honest and frugal, the means of obtaining easy and comfortable subsistence for themselves and their families. [....] To one thing they must make up their minds, or, they will be disappointed in every expectation of happiness as Americans. They must cast off the European skin, never to resume it. They must look forward to their posterity, rather than backward to their ancestors; they must be sure that whatever their own feelings may be, those of their children will cling to the prejudices of this country, and will partake of that proud spirit, not unmingled with disdain, which you have observed is remarkable in the general character of this people, and as perhaps belonging peculiarly to those of German descent, born in this country.
George Washington: the USA should be an "asylum to the virtuous and persecuted": <https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-06-02-0266> I had always hoped that this land might become a safe & agreeable Asylum to the virtuous & persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong; but I shall be the more particularly happy, if this Country can be, by any means, useful to the Patriots of Holland, with whose situation I am peculiarly touched, and of whose public virtue I entertain a great opinion.

# exclusivist founder quotes about "posterity"
Benjamin Franklin: Anglo-Saxons are white, "Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians", "Swedes", and "Germans" are "tawny" and should not be "increased in number": <http://www.columbia.edu/~lmg21/ash3002y/earlyac99/documents/observations.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/955635117269860372/unknown.png Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Compexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.

# statistics: overall
farm murders have never been lower than now, according to the South African Police Service (this number includes all murders of all people (owners, workers, visitors, family) on all farms, including smallholdings (but not nonfarming smallholdings)); note the gap of 2007-2009: <https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/farm-murder-rate-lowest-in-20-years-remoteness-the-reason-for-brutality-20180531> <https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-statistics-farm-attacks-murders-sa/> <https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AgriSA_Farm-Attacks_V1.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574722108915974185/unknown.png
SA has 35000 commercial farm owners, 10300 family members of commercial farm owners, 771000 commercial farm employees, and 4000000 smallholding farm owners: <https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afriforums-own-farm-murder-stats-dont-support-their-claims-20180507> <https://www.nda.agric.za/docs/statsinfo/Censcoagric2007.pdf> <https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/212633/2/Pienaar-Understanding%20the%20smallholder%20farmer%20in%20South%20Africa-1233.pdf> The number of "farm murders" is 47; this includes smallholders. Using different definitions of "farmer" results in wildly different murder rates. Including just commercial farm owners, we get 134 murders per 100000. Including family, 103 per 100000. Including workers, 5.75 per 100000. Including smallholders, 0.975 per 100000. SA's murder rate is 34 per 100000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_South_Africa>
alternately, AfricaCheck argues that statistic calculation is impossible: <https://africacheck.org/2017/05/08/analysis-calculating-farm-murder-rate-sa-near-impossible/> Previously, Burger used Statistics South Africa’s 2007 census of commercial agriculture’s estimate of 32,375 full-time farmers to indicate the murder rate of farmers. This was how he calculated that there were 133 farm murders per 100,000 farmers, using the Transvaal Agricultural Union of South Africa’s estimate of 39 farmers murdered in 2012. Chris van Zyl, the union’s assistant general, told Africa Check that the recorded murders included farmers on non-commercial farms and agricultural smallholdings. Burger excluded family members, workers and visitors from the calculation. However, the 2007 figure of 32,375 full-time farmers is not appropriate to use, as the survey was only conducted on commercial farms registered to pay value-added tax (VAT). [....] The survey also estimated that there were an additional 10,272 family members involved in farming activities, 4,923 owners in partnership directly involved in farming activities and 770,933 paid employees. Including the full-time farmers, this added up to 818,503. If this farming population is used, the farm murder rate for 2015/16 would be 5.6 murders per 100,000 people living and/or working on farms registered to pay value-added tax. However, the total population of people living on farms and smallholdings, which do not pay value-added tax, will be larger.

# statistics: race
the Boer-dominated Transvaal Agricultural Union's data on farm murders shows a very variable white farm murder count, making trend analysis difficult: <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724> <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4428330-Farm-Murders-Racial-Breakdown-1990-2018.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574720347585380362/unknown.png
according to the South African Police Service, 74% of farm murders were white and 83% were farm owners: <https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-south-africas-crime-statistics-for-2017-18/> In 2017/18, the police recorded 62 murders during 58 attacks. Of those murdered, 52 were the owners or occupiers of the farm/smallholding, 9 were farm workers and one was a farm manager. Forty-two murders took place on farms, 15 on smallholdings and one at a cattle post. The majority of the murder victims (46) were white.

# statistics: reliability
reliability (or lack thereof) of the statistics: <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724> Dr de Kock told Fact Check that the police's farm murder count was reliable. But he said the "biggest problem" with the data was that police stations do not specifically record hate-based murders or "farm murders". "So a murder, wherever that murder happens, whatever the motive for that murder, will just be registered as a murder." Dr de Kock also pointed out that more than half of farm attacks or murders take place on "small holdings", usually plots of one or two hectares on the edge of towns and cities. "In many cases people don't actually farm on those," he said, explaining that while some people might farm on a small scale, "strictly speaking [they're] no commercial farmer". Dr Burger said the lack of regular government statistics on farm attacks and murders makes it "extremely difficult to accurately define the extent of the problem". But he also said the union works hard to ensure the credibility of its data, which he relies on himself. And according to Dr Burger, murder statistics reported by different groups tended to be similar.

# no evidence that farm attacks are motivated by race

The statemetn is made bearing in mind all research conducted in previous hearings and governmetn commissions of inquiries. Racial tensions have been present in South Africa for many decades and continue to be the case in democratic South Africa. [.....] Safety and security challenges persist in farming communities. Violence in farming communities is not based on the ground of race but reflects a reality where issues of racial segregation, land tenure, and economic [dis]empowerment provide the context for considering the root causes of crime which occur in farming communities. In addition, the Commission notes that the term "farm attacks and/or murder" i[s] inappropriate.

Herbert Brownell, Attorney General under Eisenhower, announced in 1954 (!) that only immigrants who posed a risk to national security, to public safety, or of fleeing their trial would be detained: <https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/09/12/11-11-1954.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/852279875858333696/11-11-1954.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941877170517721158/unknown.png
as a result, the number of people in immigration detention fell dramatically: in 1955, there were just four (!!) people in immigration detention seeking entry to the US: <https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2011/09/12/01-26-1955.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941886234719035452/01-26-1955.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941886289244987402/unknown.png
the policy was so notable that in 1958 the Supreme Court claimed that "this policy [of non-detention] reflects the humane qualities of an enlightened civilization": <https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/357/185.html> <https://archive.ph/wip/jtzWg> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941887052297957406/unknown.png

# background: start of modern mass detention
Minian 2018: from 1954 to 1980, border crossers were routinely released on parole -- not detained! -- and expected to return to court for their immigration hearing; that changed in 1981, as a response to the Mariel Boatlift: <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/opinion/sunday/border-detention-tear-gas-migrants.html> <https://archive.ph/NeEXv> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941887680625639475/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/941888288900399164/unknown.png

# background: scope of internment
Kassie 2019: the system of deterrence via the pain of extended detention is uniquely modern: On an average day in 1980, just 3,000 people were in detainment.

# what's the alternative?
When the US did a trial program very similar to this proposal it was extremely successful. That's because mass detention is not just inhumane, it's unnecessary! Even if we wanted to charge and try every person who crossed the border, very few would need to be detained for the months until their trial. Virtually all of those released from detention showed up to court: <https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/190925acluhousejudiciaryicedetentionstatementforrecord.pdf> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/852284495126331452/190925acluhousejudiciaryicedetentionstatementforrecord.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/852284423999324210/ExlXtisXAAEUlal.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/852284435944308796/ExlX1XcWQAgooMV.png

# the problem
CHGO = civilian household gun ownership
[1] CHGO has many, large negative health outcomes: Higher suicide, higher homicide, higher accidents, associated economic costs
[2] CHGO has few, small positive health outcomes: Individual hunting, individual target practice
[3] CHGO has little impact on outcomes for democracy, freedom, worker power, and minority power

# the solutions: consumer side
[1] Short-term: Legalize most or all drugs, end poverty via welfare, shift justice system from retributive to rehabilitative: Reduce violent crime in general, reducing gun deaths
[2] Short-term: Make gun licenses mandatory for new gun purchases, waiting periods mandatory: Significantly reduce suicide and homicide by delaying purchase, and overall gun levels by increasing difficulty of purchase (6 states: DC, CA, WA, IL, MA, NY)
[3] Short-term: Make gun safes mandatory for new gun purchases: Enormously reduce household gun theft, which is the primary source of illegal guns
[4] Short-term: Enact domestic violence restraining/protection order (DVRO or DVPO) gun relinquishment laws: Significantly reduce intimate partner homicide, the 2nd largest category of gun violence
[5] Short-term: Enact extreme risk protection order (ERPO) gun relinquishment laws: Allows family members, police to petition a court that someone's firearms present a risk to themselves or others; Significantly reduce suicide, may reduce mass shootings
[6] Short-term: Prohibit gun purchases among people under 21: 70% of murder occurs before offenders reach 30 years old; restricting guns from younger people may significantly reduce homicide
[7] Long-term: Shift ownership entirely from CHGO to community armories: Maintain right to bear arms while reducing likelihood of theft, suicide, or homicide

# the solutions: producer side
[8] Short-term: Increase taxes on civilian gun factories and fund voluntary gun buybacks: Reduces gun levels and is easily worth it (guns cause $176bn/yr in damages)
[9] Long-term: Prohibit commercial gun production: Requires less state coercion than seizing guns from houses and significantly reduces future gun supply

# good existing law
[0] Short-term: Enact serious crime gun relinquishment laws: Persons convicted of serious crimes (over 1y in prison) should be prohibited from gun ownership (49 states, Vermont does violent crime only)

firearm prevalence correlates with overall violent crime: <http://www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/jpj_firearm_ownership.pdf> <https://web.archive.org/web/20171013095732/http://www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/jpj_firearm_ownership.pdf> The current analysis used suicide by firearm as a proxy for firearm ownership. Examining violent crime, homicide, rape, robbery, and assault for 1,997 counties in the United States, the findings indicate that increased prevalence of firearms was associated with increased violent crime, homicide, rape, robbery, and assault. The results of this study suggest that a decrease in prevalence of firearms has the potential to decrease violent crime in the United States.Control variables used: region (Northeast, South, Midwest, West), Beale codes (rural, urban-adjacent, urban), residential mobility, ethnic heterogeneity, female-headed households, poverty rate, unemployment rate, population at risk (youth) rate, population age, population density

What this table discloses is that after 26-plus years the vast majority of GGB [Golden Gate Bridge] suicide attempters (about 94%) are still alive or have died from natural causes. The comparison group of hospital cases has had similar experiences; 89% are still alive or are dead from natural means after 15 years. Conversely, only five to seven percent killed themselves and some six to 11% had died from all violent causes combined. Even if we compensate for underenumeration by doubling our frequencies it still means that about 90% of the study subjects were alive or had come to a natural non-violent end."""

# theory: increased production
ineffective because firms just increase productions: <http://www.bapress.ca/Journal/Gun%20Buybacks%20and%20Firm%20Behavior--%20Do%20Buyback%20Programs%20Really%20Reduce%20the%20Number%20of%20Guns.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191110180037/http://www.bapress.ca/Journal/Gun%20Buybacks%20and%20Firm%20Behavior--%20Do%20Buyback%20Programs%20Really%20Reduce%20the%20Number%20of%20Guns.pdf> Thus, any anticipated (repeated) buyback’s impact on future stock levels of firearms depends critically on the commit ability of the durable-goods manufacturer, independent of the buyers’ reselling and arbitrage activities. Moreover, regardless of commitment ability, the model suggests the imperfectly competitive firms may, at least partially, counteract the buyback program, making any governmental buyback less effective at reducing future firearm stocks than expected.

Thus, studies of a gun buy-back programme may require longer time frames before some level of success is achieved (Neill & Leigh, 2008).

Hemenway and Solnick 2015's data comes from the National Crime Victimization Survey -- which asks crime victims what happened, and is *not* reported (police) data whatsoever: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743515001188> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.029> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/811122658800173096/hemenway2015.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1138655568903553024/Fwip_hsXwAMFabf.png

# response to Hemenway #2: "what about surveys with 2.5 million usages?"
Hemenway 1997: the Kleck data implies that guns were used for self-defense in 845,000 burglaries, but there were only 6,000,000 x 0.22 x 0.42 x 0.33 = 182,000 burglaries at which a gun could reasonably have been used: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09332480.1997.10542033> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/09332480.1997.10542033> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1138656435471929456/hemenway1997.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1138656991166865469/image.png """All attempts at external validation of the 2.5 million figure show that it is an enormous overestimate (Hemenway, in press). For example, in 34% of the times a gun was used for self-defense, the offender was allegedly committing a burglary. In other words, guns were reportedly used by defenders for self-defense in approximately 845,000 burglaries. From sophisticated victimization surveys, however,we know that there were fewer than 6 million burglaries in the year of the survey and in only 22% of those cases was someone certainly at home (1.3 million burglaries). Since only 42% of U.S. households own firearms, and since the victims in two thirds of the occupied dwellings were asleep, the 2.5 million figure requires us to believe that burglary victims use their guns in self-defense more than 100% of the time. A more reasonable estimate of self-defense gun use during burglary comes from an analysis of Atlanta police department reports. Examining home invasion crimes during a four-month period, researchers identified 198 cases of unwanted entry into a single-family dwelling while someone was at home (Kellermann, Westphal, Fisher, and Harvard 1995). In 6 of these cases, an offender obtained the victim's gun. In only 3 cases (1.5%) was a victim able to use a firearm in self-defense."""

Specifically, participants indicated the extent to which they agree (1=agree strongly to 5=disagree strongly) with statements such as “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class” (reverse scored). Scores on the four items were coded so that high scores are indicative of elevated levels of symbolic racism. A test of the reliability of the scale showed the four items corresponded closely with each other as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha level of 0.8 and the emergence of a single factor from exploratory factor analysis of the scale. We utilized the average score across the four items to produce a scale ranging 1=lowest symbolic racism score, to 5=highest symbolic racism score.
higher opposition to gun regulations is predicted by higher symbolic racism, higher firearm ownership, higher libertarianism, lower egalitarianism, and lower income: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-015-9326-4> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/s11109-015-9326-4> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639991539585515530/unknown.png

# stolen firearms
based on surveys of firearm owners, ~460,000 firearms are stolen from individuals every year: <https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/3/5/38.abstract> <https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/rsfjss/3/5/38.full.pdf> Approximately 2.4 percent of gun owners (CI: 1.6–3.6) reported having had one or more stolen from them in the past five years, the mean number at 1.9 (a range of 1 to 6). Assuming that theft was evenly distributed across the years, we estimate that approximately 2.3 million guns were stolen over the past five years (five hundred thousand annually).
Hemenway Azrael Miller 2017: in 2015, based on a survey of 3949 firearm owners, ~380,000 firearms are stolen from individuals every year; gun owners who reported safely storing their guns were 3x less likely to report gun thefts: <https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-017-0109-8> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1186/s40621-017-0109-8> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/980582562101596190/hemenway2017.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/980582741320028160/unknown.png """Among gun owners, 2.4% report having one or more guns stolen in the past 5 years (Table 1). The mean number of guns stolen per incident was 1.5(95% CI: 1.0,2.0). Using data from the April 2015 survey, we estimated that 22% of US adults are gun owners (Azrael et al. 2015), consistent with findings from the General Social Surveys from the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center (Smith and Son 2015). Using these results, and given approximately 242 million adults lived in the US (average for 2011–2015), we estimate that there were 1.2 million incidents of gun theft over a 5-year period, or about 250,000 incidents per year. With 1.5 guns stolen per incident, we estimate that approximately 380,000 guns (95% CI 260,000,510,000) were stolen per year."""
based on FBI crime statistics, ~320,000 firearms are stolen from individuals and gun stores every year: <https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2017/07/25/436533/stolen-guns-america/> Gun theft is not a minor problem in the United States. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), during the four-year period from 2012 to 2015, nearly half a billion dollars worth of guns were stolen from individuals nationwide, amounting to an estimated 1.2 million guns. Twenty-two thousand guns were stolen from gun stores during this same period.

Collins et al 2018: guns flow from states with weak firearm laws to states with strong firearm laws; each additional law decreases by 1.56% the portion of firearms traced to a source in that state: (laws: dealer licensing for handguns, waiting periods, buyer licensing, registration of handgun sales, prohibition for violent misdemeanors, mandatory firearm relinquishment after prohibition, universal background checks, and straw purchase bans): <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11524-018-0251-9> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1007/s11524-018-0251-9> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/980583619720523846/collins2018.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643145969004707850/unknown.png
unformatted, unread: firearm control is effective at reducing illegal firearm ownership and trafficking to other states: <https://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/full/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.5.01>: Because an estimated 270 million guns are in private hands nationwide, effective control is said to be beyond reach (Azrael et al. 2017). But this “futility” claim is in our judgment based on a misunderstanding of how guns come to be used in criminal violence. Despite that the number of private guns is enough to arm every adult, the great majority of adults (78 percent) do not in fact own one. **The main concern should be less about the current stock of guns in private hands and more about the flow of guns: the ease of obtaining one for criminal purposes.** [....] Real-world markets tend to be a good deal messier than Economics 101 reveals, and underground markets particularly so. [....] **[T]he money price is not the only or necessarily the most important cost to obtaining a gun outside the formal market. Other types of transactions costs are relevant, including the search time required for the buyer and seller to find each other, the payments to a broker or other intermediary, and the risk of arrest.** [....] We report evidence suggesting that in some respects the underground market is sensitive to regulation. For example, **when Virginia adopted a one gun per month maximum on handgun sales to any one customer, that state’s prominence as a “source” state in trafficking to Massachusetts and other states with relatively stringent regulations dropped sharply** (see Braga 2017).

# use in crime
most firearm used in crimes come from household thefts: <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092149> Guns are legal commodities, but violent offenders typically obtain their guns by illegal means. Our knowledge of these transactions comes primarily from trace data on guns recovered by the police and from occasional surveys of gun-involved offenders. **Because most guns used in crime are sourced from the stock of guns in private hands (rather than a purchase from a licensed dealer), the local prevalence of gun ownership appears to influence the transaction costs and the proportions of robberies and assaults committed with guns rather than knives or other weapons**. Nonetheless, regulations that govern licensed dealers have been linked to trafficking patterns and in some cases to the use of guns in crime.
of gun trafficking incidents, 32-34% involved guns stolen from stores or residences: <https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2017/07/25/436533/stolen-guns-america/> A 2000 ATF report that reviewed all firearms trafficking investigations undertaken by the agency between July 1996 and December 1998—the most recent such study the agency has conducted—found that nearly 14 percent of those cases involved guns stolen from licensed gun dealers and another 10 percent involved guns stolen from private residences.11 These investigations involved more than 9,300 illegally trafficked guns.12 Another study analyzed data on 893 guns recovered by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Firearms Trafficking Unit in 2008 and found that for close to 32 percent of these firearms, their original owners claimed they had been stolen.13

# united states
the seriously mentally ill don't disproportionately commit crimes (4% population, 4% crimes) and they use less firearms in the crimes they do commit: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/> [S]urprisingly little population-level evidence supports the notion that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are more likely than anyone else to commit gun crimes. **According to Appelbaum,25 less than 3% to 5% of US crimes involve people with mental illness, and the percentages of crimes that involve guns are lower than the national average for persons not diagnosed with mental illness.** Databases that track gun homicides, such as the National Center for Health Statistics, similarly show that fewer than 5% of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness.26 [....] [A] number of the most common psychiatric diagnoses, including depressive, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorders, have no correlation with violence whatsoever.18 **Community studies find that serious mental illness without substance abuse is also “statistically unrelated” to community violence.40** At the aggregate level, the vast majority of people diagnosed with psychiatric disorders do not commit violent acts—only about 4% of violence in the United States can be attributed to people diagnosed with mental illness.41,42

# lone wolves
the vast majority of violence is not done by "loners": <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/> Contrary to the image of the marauding lone gunman, social relationships also predict gun violence. Regression analyses by Papachristos et al. demonstrate that up to 85% of shootings occur within social networks.60 In other words, **people are far more likely to be shot by relatives, friends, enemies, or acquaintances than they are by lone violent psychopaths.** Meanwhile, a report by the police department of New York City found that, in 2013, a person was “more likely to die in a plane crash, drown in a bathtub or perish in an earthquake” than be murdered by a crazed stranger in that city.61

# poor prediction by psychologists
psychologists are bad at predicting gun violence: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/: [R]esearch dating back to the 1970s suggests that psychiatrists using clinical judgment are not much better than laypersons at predicting which individual patients will commit violent crimes and which will not. [....] Thirty-three years later, Swanson put it even more succinctly: **“psychiatrists using clinical judgment are not much better than chance at predicting which individual patients will do something violent and which will not.”**31,45 [unformatted]

Peck 2019: <https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=R44618> <https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R44618/14> """Generally, the courts have adopted a two-step framework for evaluating Second Amendment challenges. First, courts ask whether the regulated person, firearm, or place comes within the scope of the Second Amendment’s protections. If not, the law does not implicate the Second Amendment. But if so, the court next employs the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny—rational basis, intermediate, or strict scrutiny—to assess whether the law passes constitutional muster. In deciding what level of scrutiny is warranted, courts generally ask whether the challenged law burdens core Second Amendment conduct, like the ability to use a firearm for self-defense in the home. If a law substantially burdens core Second Amendment activity, courts typically will apply strict scrutiny. Otherwise, courts generally will apply intermediate scrutiny. Most challenged laws have been reviewed for intermediate scrutiny, where a court asks whether a law is substantially related to an important governmental interest."""

The courts of appeals have uniformly adopted a two-part test: courts ask first whether activity or conduct is protected by the Second Amendment and, if it is, they apply some form of means-end scrutiny to determine constitutionality. Although some circuit judges have advocated rejecting the two-part test in favor of a “text, history, and tradition” approach (including then-Judge Kavanaugh), no federal court of appeals has adopted that framework—or any methodology that jettisons the two-part test.

Without exception, every federal court of appeals to have considered the question has upheld a ban on large-capacity magazines (indeed, a district judge in California recently “became the first federal court in the nation to invalidate LCM restrictions”). The courts of appeals have uniformly upheld bans on so-called “assault weapons.” (Some have done so under Step 1, ruling that “assault weapons” have no Second Amendment protection whatsoever; others have done so under Step 2, upholding the bans under intermediate scrutiny.) These courts have, in addition, consistently rejected facial challenges to the firearms prohibition for felons—and many other categories of prohibited persons: “Facial challenges to the statute’s constitutionality have failed in every circuit to have considered the issue.” They have consistently rejected challenges to laws banning, or tightly regulating, possession of certain types of dangerous and unusual weapons. For example, “Every post-Heller circuit court that has addressed the machine gun issue has rejected Second Amendment claims.” The amount of agreement over such a wide swath of regulations is noteworthy."""

# judeo-bolshevism: the Soviet Union was not dominated by Jewish people
#####o
# summary
Jewish people were very overrepresented in some institutions of Soviet power, but only slightly overrepresented in all institutions of Soviet power, especially when Jewish urbanicity and Soviet preference for urban residents is taken into account. Regardless, Jewish people made up a small minority of powerholders, and could not have controlled the Soviet Union. Beyond that, Communist Jews saw themselves as committed Marxists, firmly opposed to Judaism, who did not prioritize their Jewish ethnicity: any claims of a Jewish plots to control the Soviet Union must contend that a small minority of committed communist atheists were actually mere puppets of their spooky scary evil Jewish genetics.

In each of the troikas ('threes') that headed the party, at least until 1917, there was always one Jew, if not two, except for the years 1903 to 1905: from 1905 to 1907 Viktor Taratuta; from 1907 to 1911, Grigori Zinovyev; from 1911 to 1914, Lev Kamenev and Grigori Zinovyev; and in the war years Zinovyev was still there. Among the Jewish leaders at the middle level - the connecting link between the leadership in exile and the head of the branches in Russia - were: Rozalya Zemlyachka, Maxim Litvinov (Valakh), Viktor Taratuta (already mentioned) and Emelian Yaroslavsky (Gubelman). Three of the fifteen members of the Bolshevik Central Committee of 1907 were Jews: Zinovyev, Goldenberg, Taratuta. At the Prague Conference two of the six members of the centre were Jews: Zinovyev and Shvartsman.60 In the period between the February and October Revolutions in 1917, the percentage of Jews in the Bolshevik Party leadership rose, mainly as a result of the adhesion of the 'inter-regional' group led by Lev Trotsky. In April 1917, three of the nine members of the Central Committee were Jews: Kamenev, Zinovyev and Sverdlov. In August of that year, six of the twenty-one members of the Central Committee were Jews: Kamenev, Sokolnikov, Sverdlov, Zinovyev, Trotsky and Uritsky.

In 1918, four of the fourteen members of the Central Committee were Jews (Sverdlov, Trotsky, Zinovyev and Sokolnikov); in 1919, again four of the nineteen Central Committee members were Jews (Kamenev, Radek, Trotsky and Zinovyev), while in 1921 five of the twenty-five members (20%) were Jews. The ratio was not as high among the candidate members. In 1939 there were eleven Jewish full members and three candidate members, in all 10.1% of the ruling body, at a time when the Jews formed just over 4% of the Party membership. In the Politburo in the first half of the 1920s the Jews comprised from 23% to 37% (Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinovyev), but after the 'United opposition' had been ousted from the party leadership in 1926 not one Jew remained in the Politburo. In the 1930s, however, there was one Jew in this important organization, Lazar Kaganovich, who also held a central position in the Communist Party in the Ukraine. In the 1920s and 1930s, Jews held important posts in other party organizations, such as the Organizational Bureau and the Secretariat; among them were Lazar Kaganovich, M. Kaganovich (younger brother of Lazar), Lev Mekhlis, M. Rukhimovich, A. Yakovlev (Epshtein) and Ian Gamarnik. Most of them were liquidated in the 1930s purges, although not necessarily because they were Jews."""
Pinkus 1988: during the 1930s, Jewish people in the Soviet Union formed a similar role as of Germans under the Tsar: very involved in the educated bureaucracy; however, among the senior government as a whole, Jews made up just 6% of "elite" positions: <https://search.worldcat.org/title/15592472> <https://library.lol/main/9A4B8AEC8EF3F279DA008F8A26FF3C11> The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority """In 1936 (before the purges), there were six Jews among the twenty members of the Soviet government: Yagoda (Minister of the Interior and the Security Services), L. Kaganovich (Communications), M. Litvinov (Foreign Affairs), Rozengolts (Foreign Trade), Y. Dreitser (Internal Trade), A. Kalmanovich (Agricultural Units).69 By 1939, the following Jewish Ministers and Deputy-Ministers were still in the government: L. Kaganovich, M. Kaganovich, B. Antselovich, M. Berman, L. Ginzburg, L. Vannikov and P. Zhemchuzhina-Molotov. Thus, throughout the whole period, Jewish representation in the central administration was well above any proportional relation to the national ratio of the Jews in the Soviet Union, and very high in comparison with all the other national minorities. We can say that the Jews in the Soviet Union took over the privileged position, previously held by the Germans in tsarist Russia. In the senior ranks of the bureaucracy, the Jews held important posts in many ministries, but were particularly numerous in the Ministries of the Interior, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade. If we take all three sectors of the administration, it emerges that of the 417 people who constituted the ruling elite of the Soviet Union in the mid 1920s (the members of the Central Executive Committee, the Party Central Committee, the Presidium of the Executive of the Soviets of the USSR and the Russian Republic, the governments of the Soviet Union and the Russian Republic, the Ministers, and the Chairman of the Executive Committee), twenty-seven (that is 6%) were Jews.70 [....] 69 Vlast Sovetov, 1936, no. 9 (10)[.] 70 Larin, Antisemitizm, p. 114."""

The geographical and social background of these Jews is interesting: they came from Jewish families that had taken the path of assimilation, coming from the Ukraine ('new' Russia) and inner Russia; they had been educated in Russian schools; their parents had been agriculturists or settlers (Zinovyev, Trotsky, Yaroslavsky) or 'workers by brain' (Litvinov, Zemliachka, Kamenev); the exception was Lazar Kaganovich, who came from a working-class family (his father was a shoemaker). What drew them to the Bolshevik Party was its centralizing and dictatorial character, which offered them an outlet for their revolutionary drive and at the same time promised a solution to their national problem by allowing them to become part of the society surrounding them and of its Russian culture."""
Pinkus 1988: the proportion of Jewish people in leadership declined during the 1930s as educated national elites arose: <https://search.worldcat.org/title/15592472> <https://library.lol/main/9A4B8AEC8EF3F279DA008F8A26FF3C11> The Jews of the Soviet Union: The History of a National Minority """The proportion of Jews decreased in the 1930s during the course of a natural process whereby a national elite came into being and found a place in the central administration; but it was still true that the Jews held a share in government more than double their proportion in the population. In the economic elite in the Soviet Union in the 1920s, the share of the Jews was even more impressive, reaching as high as ten per cent.71 [....] 70 Larin, Antisemitizm, p. 114. 71 Ibid., p. 115."""

In the Ukraine and Belorussia, the Jews' share in the party leadership was not as high. Although Lazar Kaganovich was one of the most powerful figures in the Ukraine in the late 1920s, the Jews were not adequately represented in the higher levels of the institutions, given their proportionate strength in the party. The reason for this was the policy of accelerating Ukrainization and Belorussification in these republics, which took an extreme nationalist form and not only ousted the Russians from the leadership but also representatives of their national minorities - mainly the Jews, because of their influence in central government and tendencies towards Russification."""

In 1922, the year of the membership census, there were 19,564 Jews in the Party - 5.21% of all Communist Party members, while only 2,217 Germans were members, out of a population of 1,400,000. In 1927, the last year in this period for which there are complete data, there were 49,627 Jewish members, 4.34% of all Party members (as compared with 0.49% Germans, and 1.66% Poles). As regards their social structure, the Jewish members of the party were classified as follows: workers - 67.5% in the Ukraine, 47.8% in the Russian Republic, and 7.22% in Belorussia; clerical workers - 28.8% in the Ukraine, 48% in the Russian Republic, and 19% in Belorussia.61 The last available data on the Jews' share in the party is from the Ukraine in 1940, where Jews formed 13.4% of party membership in the Republic, but represented only 4.9% of the Jewish population. Since the Jews in the Ukraine in 1939 comprised more than half the Jews in the Soviet Union, and since the ratio of Jews in the Communist Party in the Russian Republic and in Belorussia was not very different from that in the Ukraine, some researchers have concluded that the Jews constituted 4.9% of the Communist Party in the whole of the Soviet Union.62 However, an analysis of the 1940 development of party membership among other nationalities, which were beginning to take a more important place than they had done in the 1920s, makes it seem more likely that the percentage of Jews in the Party in 1939 was nearer its 1927 level of 4.3%, or even less.

the "Senate Committee" results are literally just some insane dude's rambling -- he claims most Bolshevik leaders were Jews from Brooklyn, New York: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-5b1CpjAcQ&list=PLNGRQi2kyMcIARUW8gw3ZNm8H62lmcIF8&index=22> <https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030480051/cu31924030480051_djvu.txt> """The latest startling information, given me by some one who says that there is good authority for it — and I ani to be given the exact figures later on and have them checked up properly by the proper authorities — is this, that in December, 1918. in the northern community of Petrograd, so-called — that is what they call that section of the Soviet regime under the presidency of the man known as Mr. Apfelbaum — out of 388 members, only 16 happened to be real Russians, and all the rest Jews, with the exception possibly of one man, who is a negro from America, who calls himself Prof. Gordon, and 265 of the members of this northern commune govern- ment, that is sitting in the old Smolny Institute, came from the lower East Side of New York — 265 of them. If that is true, and they are going to check it up for me — certain Eussians in New York who have been there and investigated the facts — I think that that fits into what you are driving at. In fact, I am very much impressed with this, that moving around here I find that certain Bolsheviki propagandists are nearly all Jews — apostate Jews. I have been in the so-called People's House, at 7 East Fifteenth Street, New York, which calls itself also the Rand School of Social Science, and I have visited that at least six times during the last eleven weeks or so, buying their literature, and some of the most seditious stuff I have ever found against our own Government, and 19 out of every 20 people I have seen there have been Jews."""

# judeo-bolshevism: who killed the tsar / czar (common neo-Nazi talking point)
#####o
list of people who killed the Czar: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_the_Romanov_family#Executioners> Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were **Yakov Yurovsky**, **Grigory P. Nikulin**, **Mikhail A. Medvedev (Kudrin)**, **Peter Ermakov**, **Stepan Vaganov**, **Alexey G. Kabanov** (former soldier in the tsar's Life Guards and Chekist assigned to the attic machine gun),[48] **Pavel Medvedev**, **V. N. Netrebin**, and **Y. M. Tselms**. Filipp Goloshchyokin, a close associate of Yakov Sverdlov, being a military commissar of the Uralispolkom in Yekaterinburg, however did not actually participate, and two or three guards refused to take part.
Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky: raised Jewish, converted Lutheran <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Yurovsky> Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky was the eighth of ten children born to Mikhail Yurovsky, a glazier, and his wife Ester Moiseevna (1848–1919), a seamstress. He was born on 19 June [O.S. 7 June] 1878 in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Russia. The Yurovsky family were Jewish. The historian Helen Rappaport writes that the young Yurovsky studied the Talmud in his early youth, while the family seems to have later attempted to distance themselves from their Jewish roots; this may have been prompted by the prejudice toward Jews frequently exhibited in Russia at the time.[1] Shortly before fully devoting himself to the cause of revolution, in the early twentieth century Yurovsky converted to Lutheranism.[1]
Grigory Petrovich Nikulin: raised in a parish school: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Petrovich_Nikulin> Nikulin was born and raised in Zvenigorodka, Kiev province, Russian Empire. He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (Пётр Иосифович) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.
Mikhail Aleksandrovich Medvedev-Kudrin: raised in a parish school: <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2,_%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87> В 1900 году закончил церковно-приходскую школу в селе Изгар, в 1900—1908 годах жил в Чистополе, где начал учиться в школе ремесленных учеников, но после второго класса был вынужден бросить учёбу из-за тяжёлого материального положения семьи[1]. [In 1900 he graduated from a parish school in the village of Izgar. In 1900-1908 he lived in Chistopol, where he began to study at a school of artisanal students, but after the second grade he was forced to drop out of school due to the difficult financial situation of his family.[1]]
Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov: raised in a parish school: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ermakov> Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov was born on 13 December [O.S. 1 December] 1884, and raised in and around the Verkh-Isetskiy workhouse in Yekaterinburg, Russian Empire. Ermakov graduated from the local parish school, working thereafter as a metal craftsman, and between 1909 and 1912, is listed as living in Vologodskaya Province.

President Lyndon B. Johnson and civil rights activists used the event to galvanize support for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was signed July 2nd. Thanks to an informant, the bodies were found and in November the FBI charged 21 men with depriving the three activists of their civil rights. The more traditional charge of murder, which is a state crime, was not possible because Mississippi refused to prosecute them. Even then, a judge who was a segregationist dismissed the indictments, which had to be overruled by the Supreme Court. Seven of the men were finally convicted in 1967, becoming the first ever conviction for the killing civil rights workers in the state. Their sentences were from three to 10 years and none of them ended up serving more than six. 41 years later, Mississippi finally charged someone for the murders, Killen, and he was convicted of three counts of manslaughter with three consecutive 20 year sentences."""

First, the internal confl ict infl uenced the development of Peru’s constitutional order in two ways: it created the crisis that enabled a new constitution to be written, and it weakened the Left and popular organizations necessary to contest neo liberalism.1 Analysts agree that the 1993 constitution was more authoritarian and neoliberal than its 1979 predecessor (Rubio Correa 2012; Tei vai nen 2002; Planas 1999; García Belaunde 1996). It rolled back social features of the 1979 constitution and facilitated the concentration of power in the hands of the executive branch of government.2 It also proved remarkably enduring, in large measure because it aligned Peru with neoliberal precepts. Peru did not emulate other countries in the region that undertook constitutional reforms (often called republican “refounding”) as part of a left turn (Cameron and Hershberg 2010; Levitsky and Roberts 2011; Ellner 2014). One could argue that the Shining Path foreclosed the possibility of a left turn by creating an emergency situation which resulted in a constitution that locked in a neoliberal economic model and, with it, a correspondingly limited electoral democracy.3"""

Abrams 2006: example 1, from Russia-Chechnya war: <https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2006.31.2.42> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.2307/4137516> """[1991-6:] In 1991 Chechnya's first president, Dzhokar Dudayev, took the additional step of declaring independence. Federal forces invaded Chechnya in December 1994 to reestablish control in the breakaway republic. For the next twenty months, Russian federal forces battled Chechen guerrillas in an asymmetric war based in Chechnya.""""""From the onset of military operations until the cease-fire in August 1996, some 70 percent of Russians opposed the war.61 Disdain for the war manifested itself most clearly in public attitudes toward Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Opinion polls rated his approval at only 3 percent, just a few points lower than the Russian public's support for Yeltsin's handling of the Chechen problem in general.6""""""[1999-on:] A large bomb was detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast Moscow, killing 94 civilians. On September 13, another large bomb blew up an apartment building on the Kashmirskoye highway, killing 118 civilians. On September 16, a truck bomb exploded outside a nine-story apartment complex in the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, killing 17 civilians. The Kremlin quickly fingered the Chechens as the perpetrators.7""""""Polls conducted after the terrorist attacks showed that Russians were almost twice as likely to believe that Chechen motives were now to "kill Russians," "bring Russia to its knees," "destabilize the situation in Russia," "destroy and frighten Russian society," and "bring chaos to Russian society" than to achieve "the independence of Chechnya."77""""""Popular support for war remained remarkably stable after the bombings; six months after they occurred, 73 percent of Russians favored "the advance of federal forces into Chechnya," compared with only 19 percent of Russians who wanted "peaceful negotiations with the Chechen leadership."83 Since 2000, support for President Putin's Chechnya policy has not dropped below 67 percent.8"""

The revolt from December 1987 to January 1991 killed only twenty Israeli civilians.""""""Edy Kaufman has noted that "the primary purpose of the first intifada was to communicate to Israelis the need to end the occupation of the territories."113 Terrorist acts, even in small numbers, interfered with the message. Throughout the intifada, only 15 percent of Palestinian demonstrations were violent.114 Yet an absolute majority of Israelis (80 percent) believed that the means employed by the Palestinians to protest Israeli rule were "mainly violent." Of the violent Palestinian acts, the vast majority consisted of rock throwing against the Israel Defense Forces in the territories, with few incidences of terrorism inside the Green Line. An even broader consensus of Israelis (93 percent) felt that the intifada was directed "both towards civilians and towards the army."'11""""""Compelling evidence suggests, however, that terrorism informed the Israeli view of Palestinian objectives. In a fascinating study based on the polling data contained in the Guttman report, Kaufman observed that the respondents who perceived Palestinian tactics as "mainly violent" were more likely to believe that the Palestinian goal was to "destroy Israel." Conversely, the more Israelis perceived Palestinian tactics as nonviolent, the more they believed the goal was to liberate the territories. The positive correlation between perceived Palestinian terrorism and maximalist objectives existed independent of the respondents' political affiliation, suggesting that the association was not a function of their preexisting political attitudes.11"""

In comparison, right-wing terrorist attacks caused 335 deaths, left-wing attacks caused 22 deaths, and ethnonationalist terrorists caused 5 deaths. To evaluate the ongoing threat from different types of terrorists, however, it is useful to consider the proportion of fatalities attributed to each type of perpetrator annually. In 14 of the 21 years between 1994 and 2019 in which fatal terrorist attacks occurred, the majority of deaths resulted from right-wing attacks. In eight of these years, right-wing attackers caused all of the fatalities, and in three more—including 2018 and 2019—they were responsible for more than 90 percent of annual fatalities.11 Therefore, while religious terrorists caused the largest number of total fatalities, right-wing attackers were most likely to cause more deaths in a given year"""

Squicciarini (2020) documented that French areas that were more religious in the late 19th century were less likely to introduce new technical curriculum in schools, thus forgoing skills essential for experiencing the second industrial revolution in France
^ todo reread xxx: 

For instance, the emphasis on tradition in most religions may discourage certain behaviors such as innovation and creativity, which are otherwise beneficial to economic growth (B´enabou et al., forthc). B´enabou, Ticchi, and Vindigni illustrate the potential contesting between the worldviews of science and religion in a theoretical model, where the recurrent arrival of scientific discoveries generate productivity gains, but at the same time threaten to erode religious beliefs by contradicting aspects of religious doctrines. As a result, religious elites have incentives to curb the development of science and new ideas. Examples abound of such conflicts, from the trial of Galilei in 1633 to President George W. Bush’s restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. In support of the model, Benabou, Ticchi, and Vindigni uncover that contemporary countries or US states that are more religious have fewer patents per capita. An alternative model may explain the same tendency with substitution between religion and science; if intellectual resources can be used for either religious or scientific studies, religiously interested individuals may be more inclined to engage in religious studies, thus crowding out the study of science. The proposition is not that religion and science cannot go hand-in-hand. Indeed, there are several examples of great contributors to science who were deeply religious - perhaps most famously Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727). Also, some of Europe’s largest universities - Bologna and Oxford for instance - were established by monasteries. Thus, it remains a matter of empirical testing whether religion and science contested or complemented one another.
^ todo reread xxx: 

Along the same lines, Cantoni & Yuchtman (2013) argue that the introduction of a new, productive form of human capital, such as the emergence of modern science, depends on whether the government or church see the new knowledge as threatening to their position of power. The authors argue that Islamic elites who controlled educational institutions in the Middle Ages initially promoted the study of logic and science, because the gains from spreading these skills (more converts to Islam) outweighed the costs (potential criticism of the religious elites). This period of elite support for scientific study saw the flourishing of Islamic society. However, as Islam took over in the Middle East, the gains to elites from the study of logic and science declined. Elites started to oppress the study of science, and the Muslim world fell behind. Chaney (2016) provides econometric support for these ideas. He links the decline in scientific and technological production in the Muslim world in the late Medieval period to the extensive spread of madrasas, educational centers where Islamic law was taught. Using data on book production during the period 800-1800, Chaney documents a sharply rising trend in the proportion of religious books written, accompanied by a drop in original and scientific-technical books. With our data, we can test empirically whether something similar occurred within Europe.

Over the past 10 years, research on this question has produced mixed results. Some studies have reported that rates of suicide attempt and suicidal ideation are lower among persons who have a religious affiliation (Carli et al., 2014; Dervic et al., 2004; Dervic et al., 2011; Kralovec et al., 2014; Kukoyi et al., 2010; Spencer et al., 2012), those who attend religious services more frequently (Blackmore et al., 2008; Caribe et al., 2012; Hoffman and Marsiglia, 2014; Kaslow et al., 2004; Langille et al., 2012; Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2012; Rasic et al., 2009; Rasic et al., 2011a; Rasic et al., 2011b; Robins and Fiske, 2009; Robinson et al., 2012; Rushing et al., 2013; Sisask et al., 2010; Taliaferro et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011), and those who say religion is important in their lives (Albert et al., 2005; Rasic et al., 2011a). However, these findings exist alongside a large number of studies finding no relationship between religion and suicide risk (Birkholz et al., 2004; Chatters et al., 2011; Hamdan et al., 2012; Huguelet et al., 2007; Le et al., 2012; Nonnemaker et al., 2003; Stroppa and Moreira-Almeida, 2013; Tran Thi Thanh et al., 2006; Young et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006) and a few studies suggesting religious characteristics can sometimes be a risk factor (Mihaljevic et al., 2012; Stratta et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012; Zhang and Xu, 2007; Zhao et al., 2012). Importantly, most of these studies did not assess clinical samples, and only 4 explicitly enrolled persons with mood disorders (Dervic et al., 2004; Dervic et al., 2011; Rushing et al., 2013; Stroppa and Moreira-Almeida, 2013) This leaves unanswered questions not only about the relationship between religion and suicide risk, but also more specifically about that relationship for adults with depression."""

James 5:1-6, NIV: Warning to Rich Oppressors: <https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+5%3A1-6&version=NIV> Warning to Rich Oppressors: 5 Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. 2 Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. 3 Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 4 Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 5 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.[a] 6 You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

[....] Tertullian bracketed his community’s income, deposita pietatis, with corresponding spending on beneficiaries, alumni confessionis. [....] Christianity was on the pathway to a model of society where, according to Andrea Giardina (2007, p. 768), ‘poverty assumed a central position, in the collective imagination as in the redistribution of wealth’. [....] Ambrose was an unbending defender of property rights, in particular of the right of the church to own property, quite logically so because such rights were a prerequisite for dispensing benevolentia. [....] Sermons such as these had practical implications for welfare provision. Lists of paupers eligible for support were compiled, called matricula; according to John Chrysostomos, in Antioch the number came to 3,000 (John Chrysostomos 1888, pp. 706–7)."""

# summary
Just four non-Christian writers mentioned Jesus (or something plausibly about Jesus) within the first hundred years after his death: Pliny the Younger, Suetonius, Tacitus, Josephus. Of these, only Josephus mentions any details about Jesus. (The relevant passages in Josephus are also contested as possible forgeries.) Those rest say almost nothing of value about Jesus: Pliny claims his followers worship him "as a God", Suetonius is talking about someone else, Tacitus claims Jesus was "repressed" by Pontius Pilate in Judea. Mishnah sources were hundreds of years after Jesus' death and are unreliable.

In fact, if we broaden our field of concern to the years after his death—even if we include the entire first century of the Common Era—there is not so much as a solitary reference to Jesus in any non-Christian, non-Jewish source of any kind. I should stress that we do have a large number of documents from the time—the writings of poets, philosophers, historians, scientists, and government officials, for example, not to mention the large collection of surviving inscriptions on stone and private letters and legal documents on papyrus.

# pliny: genuine early extra-biblical source, but provides no details about Jesus
#####o
# background
summary: Pliny the Younger (61-113), a magistrate in Rome, wrote dozens of letters to Trajan (53-117), a Roman emperor (98-117). Some of Pliny and Trajan's letters to each other are preserved in the "Trajan Caii Plinii Caecilii Secundi Epistolarum libros decem" or "Letters of the Younger Pliny". Pliny mentions that Christians recite a hymn to Christ, as if he were a god. But Pliny makes no mention of any details related to Yeshua ben Nazareth himself, such as his cause of death. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Younger> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan> 

# pliny is the first pagan source to mention jesus
Ehrman 1999: historicist scholar: Pliny the Younger is the first reference to Jesus in any pagan account: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/39985521> <https://u1lib.org/book/1211836/792386> <https://archive.org/details/jesusapocalyptic0000ehrm_l7z0/page/56/mode/2up> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1017531463253643315/ehrman1999.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1017531325672062996/unknown.png """The first reference to Jesus in any surviving pagan account does not come until the year 112 CE. It appears in a letter written by a governor of the Roman province of Bithynia-Pontus (northwestern part of modern-day Turkey), a Roman official named Pliny. Historians usually refer to him as Pliny the Younger, to distinguish him from his equally famous uncle—called, as you might imagine, Pliny the Elder, a widely read and prolific scientist (whose scientific curiosity led to his demise, as it turns out; when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE he decided to investigate at close range and, well, that was the end of Pliny the Elder). During his tenure as governor of his province, Pliny the Younger was in close contact with the Roman emperor, Trajan. Copies of the letters that they sent back and forth at the time still survive."""

# pliny: didn't investigate anything beyond illegal assembly
Carrier 2022: the Roman's weren't interested in investigating Jesus's life or resurrection, because they were a non-violent niche religious group: <https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/16832> <https://archive.ph/wip/1zT5F> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1017533106510639196/unknown.png """As I also said (§1), even Pliny the Younger didn’t investigate the resurrection of Jesus. And as for Pliny, so for Pilate. Maybe Sheffield should actually read Pliny’s letter. Then he’d learn Pliny conducted no investigation of the supernatural claims of Christians. Pliny tells us what he did investigate and it was not the resurrection claim.[1] This disproves Sheffield’s false assertion that he did, or any Romans would. To the contrary, Pliny says he was only interested in the crime of illegal assembly, and that the religious claims Christians made so disinterested him that as soon as he learned what they were he stopped investigating those claims, dismissing them outright. Exactly the opposite of what Sheffield claims. Trajan then even instructed Pliny to press no investigations, that it was even unworthy of the Empire to do so. Again exactly the opposite of what Sheffield claims. “Christians are not to be hunted out,” Trajan says, as that is “not in consonance with the spirit of our age,” instead he instructs Pliny Christians are only to be investigated for illegal association. No interest in the resurrection belief. It’s dismissed without inquiry. They literally care not one whit about it. As for Trajan, so for Pilate."""

Pearse 2001: <https://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/pliny/pliny_mss.htm> Like many Silver Latin writers, there is little evidence that Pliny's letters achieved the literary fame he had desired, until the revival of these writers in the Fourth century.  There is a full paraphrase of the famous letters 96 and 97 in Tertullian's Apologeticum in the second century.  This material appears again in Jerome (Chron. s.a. 108) and Eusbius (HE 3.33.3) in the Fourth Century, but quoted from Tertullian.  Cameron has analysed the quotation in Tertullian, and there is some indication that Tertullian may witness to at least one verbal variant which has not survived.

# suetonius is the second pagan source to plausibly mention jesus, but it doesn't
Ehrman 1999: historicist scholar: Suetonius is the second plausible reference to Jesus in any pagan account; however, Suetonius is discussing riots by Jewish people led by "Chrestus" between 41 and 54 CE (8/11 and 21/24 years after Jesus died), who is not Jesus: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/39985521> <https://u1lib.org/book/1211836/792386> <https://archive.org/details/jesusapocalyptic0000ehrm_l7z0/page/56/mode/2up> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1017531463253643315/ehrman1999.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1017534503746539590/unknown.png """A few years later, the Roman historian Suetonius made a casual comment that some scholars have taken to be a reference to Jesus. Suetonius wrote a set of biographies on the twelve Roman Caesars who had ruled up to his own time, starting with Julius Caesar. There is a lot of valuable historical information in these books, along with a lot of juicy gossip—a gold mine for historians interested in major events of the early Roman Empire. In his Life of Claudius, emperor from 41 to 54 CE, Suetonius mentions riots that had occurred among the Jews in the city of Rome and says that the riots had been instigated by a person named "Chrestus." Some historians have maintained that this is a misspelling of the name "Christ." If so, then Suetonius is indicating that some of Jesus' followers had created havoc in the capital, a view possibly confirmed in the New Testament (see Acts 18:2). Unfortunately again, though, Suetonius tells us nothing about the man "Chrestus." If he does have Jesus in mind—and it's only a possibility, since he may be referring, actually, to someone called Chrestus!—he must be referring only to Jesus' followers, since Jesus himself had been executed some twenty years before these riots occurred."""

# tacitus: genuine early extra-biblical source
#####o
# background on tacitus
Publius Cornelius Tacitus, pronounced Takitus, was a Roman historian and Senator born 56 CE and died 120 CE, or 23/26 years and 87/90 years after Jesus died. As a senator, Tacitus had access to the Senate's archives, which lends credibility to much of his historical writing. Tacitus wrote the Annals or Histories around 116 CE, or 80/83 years after Jesus died: <https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tacitus> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_(Tacitus)> alternate titles: "Ab Excessu divi Augusti Historiarum Libri", "Books of History from the Death of the Divine Augustus"

# tacitus is the third pagan source to mention jesus
Ehrman 1999: historicist scholar: Tacitus is the third first reference to Jesus in any pagan account: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/39985521> <https://u1lib.org/book/1211836/792386> <https://archive.org/details/jesusapocalyptic0000ehrm_l7z0/page/56/mode/2up> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1017531463253643315/ehrman1999.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1019057328814817331/unknown.png """In any event, in the context of his discussion of Nero's excesses against the Christians, Tacitus does manage to say something about where they had acquired their (to him) strange beliefs and so provides us with the first bit of historical information to be found about Jesus in a pagan author: "Christus, from whom their [i.e., the Christians'] name is derived, was executed at the hands of the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius" (Annals 15.44). Tacitus goes on to indicate that the "superstition" that emerged in Jesus' wake first appeared in Judea before spreading to Rome itself. It is a pity that Tacitus does not tell us more. I suppose we should assume either that he didn't think additional information about Jesus was of much historical importance or that this was all he knew. Some scholars have noted that even this bit of knowledge is not altogether reliable: Pilate was in fact not a "procurator" but a "prefect"; that is, he not only oversaw revenue collection, but also had some military forces at his command. In any event, Tacitus's report confirms what we know from other sources, that Jesus was executed by order of the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate, sometime during Tiberius's reign. We learn nothing, however, about why Pilate ordered the execution, let alone about Jesus' life and teachings."""

# authenticity of nero-fire passage in tacitus: weak
There is much to question the provenance and veracity of Annals 15.44.[4] There is no other historical confirmation that Nero persecuted Christians for the burning of Rome. Josephus[5] and Pliny the Elder - who were both in Rome in 64 CE - didn't mention Christians at all, which seems unlikely if Nero had been blaming them for the fire. Seneca the Younger's lost On Superstition also didn't mention Christianity, according to Augustine in the 4th century. Furthermore, Neither Origen nor Tertullian use this passage despite referring to or citing Tacitus elsewhere.[6]
^ Alexander Roberts trans Schaff Philip ed 1894: the Nero-fire passage is not quoted by any Christian apologist until historian and Christian priest Sulpicius Severus (363-425), who repeats almost exactly the same statement in Chronica / Chronicle / Chronicorum Libri / Historia sacra (written 403, 370/373 years after Jesus died) Book II Chapter XXIX (2.29): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulpicius_Severus> <https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/35052.htm> <https://www.worldcat.org/title/30708787> <https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8417180W/> <https://u1lib.org/book/3194644/1b657b> """He therefore turned the accusation against the Christians, and the most cruel tortures were accordingly inflicted upon the innocent.

But despite the human help, despite the princeps’s lavishments and the appeasements of the gods, there was no getting away from the infamous belief that the conflagration had been ordered.Therefore, to dispel the rumor, Nero supplied defendants and inflicted the choicest punishments on those, resented for their outrages, whom the public called Chrestiani. (The source of the name was Christus, on whom, during the command of Tiberius, reprisal had been inflicted by the procurator Pontius Pilatus; and, though the baleful superstition had been stifled for the moment, there was now another outbreak, not only across Judaea, the origin of the malignancy, but also across the City, where everything frightful or shameful, of whatever provenance, converges and is celebrated.) The first to be seized were those who confessed, then, on their information, a mighty number was convicted, not so much on the charge of the conflagration as for their hatred of the human race.And, as they perished, mockeries were added, so that, covered in the hides of wild beasts, they expired from mutilation by dogs or, fixed to crosses and made flammable, on the dwindling of daylight they were burned for use as nocturnal illumination. Nero had offered his gardens for the spectacle and he produced circus games, mingling with the plebs in the dress of a charioteer or standing in his racer. Hence there arose - albeit for culprits who deserved the ultimate exemplary treatment - a feeling of pity, as though it were not in the public interest, but for one man’s savagery, that they were being eliminated."""

Such indeed were the precautions of human wisdom. The next thing was to seek means of propitiating the gods, and recourse was had to the Sibylline books, by the direction of which prayers were offered to Vulcanus, Ceres, and Proserpina. Juno, too, was entreated by the matrons, first, in the Capitol, then on the nearest part of the coast, whence water was procured to sprinkle the fane and image of the goddess. And there were sacred banquets and nightly vigils celebrated by married women. But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired."""

It was written at Monte Cassino, perhaps during the abbacy of Richer (1038-55AD). It derives from an ancestor written in Rustic Capitals, as it contains errors of transcription natural to that bookhand. There is some evidence that it was copied only once in about ten centuries, and that this copy was made from an original in rustic capitals of the 5th century or earlier,8 but other scholars believe that it was copied via at least one intermediate copy written in a minuscule hand.9 How the MS came to leave Monte Cassino is a matter of mystery. It was still at Monte Cassino, and was used by Paulus Venetus, Bishop of Puzzuoli, sometime between 1331 and 1344. However Boccaccio had certainly seen the text by 1371, and the MS is listed among the books given by him at his death to the monastery of S. Spirito in Florence. Whether he had 'liberated' it, or acquired it from another collector who had done so has been extensively debated, without final result. The MS is next seen in 1427, in the hands of the book-collector Niccolo Niccoli, who had furnished bookcases for Boccaccio's collection at S.Spirito. That Niccolo had not acquired the MS legitimately is suggested by a letter to him from his friend Poggio Bracciolini, asking to see it and promising to keep quiet about it. Knowledge of the text among the humanists is correspondingly limited in this period. Poggio returned the MS to Niccolo, complaining about its barbarous script, and comparing it unfavourably with a copy of it in humanist script held by another mutual friend, Salutati. At Niccolo's death in 1437, the MS passed with his books to the monastery of San Marco at Florence with the Medici as executors, and the humanist copies all date from this period or later. The editio princeps was from the press of 'Spira' at Venice, a folio volume containing only the last 6 books of the annals and the first five of the histories. It is undated, but supposed to be from either 1468 or 1470.

From this reference we can learn that there was indeed a man named Jesus (Josephus actually discusses lots of different people with that name—many of them at far greater length than the Jesus we are concerned about), that he had a brother named James (which we already knew from the New Testament; see Mark 6:3 and Gal. 1:19), and that he was thought by some people to be the Jewish messiah. The information is not much, but at least it's something. I should point out that Josephus himself does not happen to agree with those who called Jesus the messiah. We don't know how much he knew about the Christians, but it is clear that he remained a non-Christian Jew until his dying day."""

# pilate: alleged early extra-biblical source (both versions are fabricated)
#####o
Kirby 2022: the [Acts of Pilate / Acta Pilat] were fabricated by the Roman empire: <http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/actspilate.html> <https://archive.ph/6n5Rg> """When the influence of Christianity was increasing rapidly in the Empire, one of the last pagan emperors, Maximin II, two years before the Edict of Milan, attempted to bring Christianity into disrepute by publishing what he alleged to be the true 'Acts of Pilate', representing the origins of Christianity in an unsavoury guise. These 'Acts', which were full of outrageous assertions about Jesus, had to be read and memorized by schoolchildren. They were manifestly forged, as Eusebius historian pointed out at the time;' among other things, their dating was quite wrong, as they placed the death of Jesus in the seventh year of Tiberius (AD 20), whereas the testimony of Josephus' is plain that Pilate not become procurator of Judaea till Tiberius' Twelfth year (not to mention the evidence of Luke iii. 1, according to which John the Baptist began to preach in fifteenth year of Tiberius). We do not know in detail these alleged 'Acts' contained, as they were naturally suppressed on Constantine's accession to power; but we may surmise that they had some affinity with Toledoth Yeshu, an anti-Christian compilation popular in some Jewish circles in mediaeval time.'"""
Kirby 2022: the 2nd Acts of Pilate ([Gospel of Nicodemus / Evangelium Nicodemi]) were fabricated by Christians: <http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/actspilate.html> <https://archive.ph/6n5Rg> """Later in the fourth century another forged set of 'Acts of Pilate' appeared, this time from the Christian side, and as devoid of genuineness as Maximin's, to which they were perhaps intended as a counterblast. They are still extant, and consist of alleged memorials the trial, passion, and resurrection of Christ, recorded by Nicodemus and deposited with Pilate. (They are also own as the 'Gospel of Nicodemus'.) A translation of them is given in M. R. James' Apocryphal New Testament, pp. 94 ff., and they have a literary interest of their own, which does not concern us here."""

Carrier 2022: why didn't the Romans refute? they weren't interested! <https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/16798> """There’s no evidence any Romans ever investigated these claims. No investigation is mentioned anywhere, not even in the fake Acts of Pilate, nor even in the Acts of the Apostles, despite that describing court hearings before several Roman officials. In every such instance, the Romans are totally uninterested in investigating anything the Christians were claiming. Junius Gallio, uninterested; Claudius Lysias, uninterested; Antonius Felix, never once even asks about it; Porcius Festus, just laughs it off, outright saying he has no idea how to investigate such a claim, and consequently, never does; instead, he simply dismisses Paul as a lunatic. Sheffield’s own Bible reports on no other hearings before Roman authorities. We see the same response from Pliny, governor of Bithynia, eighty years later: after merely asking a couple of local believers a few questions, he dismisses the whole thing as superstitious nonsense. He conducts no investigation."""

# al-razi quote
Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi [864/865 - 925/935]: مخارق الانبياء [Mahariq al anbiya, "The Prophets' Fraudulent Tricks"]: banger quote on the "literary miracle" of the Qur'an: <https://www.councilofexmuslims.com/index.php?topic=18628.0> "You claim that the evidentiary miracle is present and available, namely, the Koran. You say: "Whoever denies it, let him produce a similar one." Indeed, we shall produce a thousand similar, from the works of rhetoricians, eloquent speakers and valiant poets, which are more appropriately phrased and state the issues more succinctly. They convey the meaning better and their rhymed prose is in better meter. ... By God what you say astonishes us! You are talking about a work which recounts ancient myths, and which at the same time is full of contradictions and does not contain any useful information or explanation. Then you say: "Produce something like it"?"

# specific criticisms
Muslim apologists often cite Quran 21:30 as proof that the Qur'an predicted the science of the Big Bang; instead, we see that the exact meaning of Qur'an 21:30 does not map neatly onto the expansion of space-time by immense energy, but instead is described as "parting", "separating", "sewn up", "unstitched", etc.: <https://quranx.com/tafsirs/21.30>

But although Muslims’ views are now out of line with the more liberal views of the British public as a whole, it should perhaps be borne in mind that as recently as 1993 the British Social Attitudes survey found 50% of the adult British public believing that “sexual relations between two adults of the same sex” were “always wrong”.) **Young Muslims are significantly more likely to agree that homosexuality should be legal (28% of 18-24 year olds, 23% of 25-34 year olds),** but even in these age groups there was a clear plurality against: as many 18-24 year olds strongly disagree as agree, strongly or otherwise, and among 25-34 year olds almost twice as many do so."""

# evidence for negative effect
among those without experience of PTSD, trigger warnings significantly increase anxiety among those who believe that words can harm people: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791618301137> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.07.002> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636098824443658242/unknown.png Participants were recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk[.] [....] A single-item screening question excluded individuals who had experienced a canonical stressor (e.g., rape, natural disaster) qualifying for Criterion A of the PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Three hundred participants completed the study. Four participants were excluded from all analyses because they reported having received a diagnosis of PTSD despite denying exposure to canonical traumatic stressors. [....] A simple slopes analysis indicated that for participants who do not have a strong belief that words can cause harm (MWCHS – 1 SD), receiving a trigger warning does not significantly increase anxiety from baseline (B = -4.57, t(265) = -1.73, ns). However, if participants have a strong belief that words can harm (MWCHS + 1 SD), trigger warnings significantly increase anxiety from baseline (B = 5.90, t(265) = 2.20, p < .05).
among those who believe trigger warnings are protecting against anxiety, trigger warnings significantly increase negative affect : <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/are-trigger-warnings-actually-helpful/> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311830060X> <http://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/j.jesp.2018.08.006> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636102465594458122/unknown.png We recruited 120 individuals from across the United States through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), but an additional 28 additional participants signed up despite not finishing the survey. Of these 148 individuals, 4 were excluded on account of English being their second language and 64 participants dropped out of the survey after informed consent but prior to answering any questions, resulting in a final sample of 80 participants. [....] There was, however, a significant warning × beliefs interaction (F(2, 702) = 4.54, p = .01, partial η2 = 0.013) (See Fig. 5). Simple effects reveal that those who believed trigger warnings to be coddling (one standard deviation below the mean) experienced more negative affect in the control condition compared to both the Trigger Warning Only condition (Mdifference= 4.69, 95% CI [1.74 7.65], p = .002, d = 0.30) and the Trigger Warning with Content condition (Mdifference= 4.15, 95% CI [1.45, 6.85], p = .003, d = 0.28).

A hefty pile of studies (419 at last count) measures the price elasticity of demand for animal foods—that is, the relationship between prices and consumption. In 2010, a meta-study determined that a 1 percent change in the price of beef causes American consumption to change by about 0.75 percent. 33 In other words, notwithstanding all the other reasons why people buy beef—including marketing, taste, and nutritional beliefs—a 10 percent price change will shift consumption by about 7.5 percent. The study found that dairy has demand elasticity of 0.65, meaning that a 10 percent price change in dairy products causes consumption to change by about 6.5 percent. 34

The Berners-Lee study separated vegetarians for vegans, and found that, of the two, vegans spent more on money.
Only one study (to our knowledge) has analyzed food expenditures at the individual level for those who are and are not vegetarians. Using a survey of 1600 Canadians, data were collected on vegetarian status (lacto-ovo vegetarians, to be specific) and self-reported monthly food expenditures. Results showed that, contrary to previous studies, vegetarians actually spent more money on food (Guillemette and Cranfield, 2012). [xxx todo reread]

Health expenditure (2000) was 218.4 billion Euros. So loss of all pets would bring in its train an increase in national health expenditure of 5.59 billion Euros (0.0256 x 218.4 billion Euros).

T is directly rendered true or false by the world. Consequently, descriptive realism is indirectly rendered true or false by the world.
Park 2019: normative realism from NMA: current scientific theories perform better than chance, ergo scientific theories are warranted: <http://www.klemens.sav.sk/fiusav/filozofia/?q=en/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.31577/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/803705298233458688/park2019.pdf> By contrast, normative realism, because it is a normative thesis, is not capable of being true or false. Even if T [a strong, current scientific theory] happens to be true, it is an open question whether it is warranted or not, as will become clear in the next section.
Park 2019: descriptive pessimism from NMA: past scientific theories were false, ergo present scientific theories are false: <http://www.klemens.sav.sk/fiusav/filozofia/?q=en/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.31577/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/803705298233458688/park2019.pdf> The descriptive PI holds that just as T1 [a past scientific theory] was false, so T2 [a current scientific theory] is false, where the former is a past theory and the latter is a present theory. This version of the PI can be inferred from Putnam’s formulation of the PI that “Just as no term used in the science of more than fifty (or whatever) years ago referred, so it will turn out that no term used now (except maybe observational terms, if there are such) refers” (1978: 25). The descriptive PI can also be inferred from Stathis Psillos’s formulation of the PI that “if most past successful scientific theories turned out to be false, then, by induction on scientific theories, one must not just remain agnostic, but rather claim that current successful scientific theories are likely to be false” (1995: 16). Keep in mind that the descriptive PI asserts that T2 is false.
Park 2019: descriptive pessimism from NMA: past scientific theories were unwarranted, ergo present scientific theories are unwarranted: <http://www.klemens.sav.sk/fiusav/filozofia/?q=en/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.31577/filozofia.2019.74.4.2> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/803705298233458688/park2019.pdf> In contrast, the normative PI holds that just as T1 [a past scientific theory] was unwarranted, so T2 [a current scientific theory] is unwarranted. The normative PI is neutral about the truth-value of T2. It says that T2 might be true, and that even though T2 is true, we cannot justifiably believe that it is true. No one has directly formulated the PI in this manner in the literature. It, however, can be inferred from James Ladyman’s formulation that “reflection on the abandonment of theories in the history of science motivates the expectation that our best current scientific theories will themselves be abandoned, and hence that we ought not to assent to them” (Ladyman, 2014). To say that we ought not to assent to present theories is to say that T2 is unwarranted.

So they think that it is better to be ontologically parsimonious and not posit it in the first place.

# determinism: quantum is truly random
quantum mechanics is genuinely random -- it does not appear possible to interpret it as deterministic: <https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/1210/in-which-way-does-quantum-mechanics-disprove-determinism> Most researchers on the foundations of quantum mechanics, however, usually side-step this question by taking the operationalist point of view. Tagline: "all we have is some procedures for setting up an experiment and the results of experiments". In this framework, you can derive Bell's theorem, which says that any phenomenon that is both deterministic and local must satisfy the Bell inequality. Quantum mechanics violates the Bell inequality (and there have been many experiments that mostly confirm this violation, there are some technical loopholes that need to be addressed in some of the experiments). This means that you must give up at least one: locality or determinism. Since without locality it becomes impossible to talk about causality, most people prefer not to give it up, and instead give up determinism.

In Crimea, Béla Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka, with Vladimir Lenin's approval,[28] had 50,000 White prisoners of war and civilians summarily executed by shooting or hanging after the defeat of general Pyotr Wrangel at the end of 1920. They had been promised amnesty if they would surrender.[29] This is one of the largest massacres in the Civil War.[30]

Some idea of the extent of sanguinary events may, however, be gauged from a confidential document entitled "A Report of the Central Administration of the Extraordinary Commissions attached to the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukraine for 1920." According to this report, which was prepared for the edification of delegates to the Fifth All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets in February 1921 and covered an area that witnessed some of the bitterest fighting of the year, the Chekists executed 3,879 persons. The Crimean port of Odessa accounted for 1,418 of the victims, far more than any of the other major population centers of the region. 85 So ended the first year on the bloodless front.""""""In its full extent, the bandit plague embraced both the central and outlying provinces of the country. In the Ukraine it was reported that banditry in the early months of 1921 had taken "the shape of a fierce struggle against Soviet power" and had resulted in substantial damage to the economic life of the region. The bandits were concentrating their attacks on tax-collecting and food-requisitioning personnel, grain-collecting stations, and rail transport. By the end of the year, according to figures that were admitted to be far from complete, 3,785 persons had been killed by bandits in the Ukraine, 1,475 abducted, and 745 wounded. Moreover, there had been almost 1,400 attacks on populated areas, 259 attacks on Soviet governmental agencies, and 145 at- tacks on tax-collecting organs. 98 Nationwide, in April 1921 , it was estimated that 165 large marauding bands numbering 51,000 men were plundering the Soviet countryside. The situation was so grave that thirty-six provinces remained under martial law until the end of 1922. 99"""

This Figure is broadly in line with certain other estimates. Vladimir Brunovskii, an agronomist employed in senior Soviet administrative posts,33 and himself an OGPU prisoner during 1923-6, reported that in the opinion of top Communist Party circles, the Vecheka had been responsible for ‘not less than 250,000 and not more than 300,000 deaths’.34 Although Brunovskii referred here specifically to the Vecheka, he probably meant to include the other republican Chekas in this assessment, which presumably covered deliberate executions as well as deaths incurred in insurrections."""

Nothing justifies the judgment that “all one can say with any assurance is that if the victims of the Jacobin terror numbered in the thousands, Lenin’s terror claimed tens if not hundreds of thousands of lives” (Pipes, Russian Revolution, p. 838). This reading does not seem to take account of the victims of the civil war in the Vende´e and the repossession of the cities of the Midi whose number greatly exceeded those of the Great Terror of the guillotine. Besides, any such global comparison should perhaps also note that France’s population in 1789 was one-sixth of Russia’s in 1917, which makes the number of victims of the Jacobin terror proportionately higher than those of the first Red terror under Lenin."""

This omits two main sources of death. First, those shot out of hand after the putting down of various “rebellions”—245 such risings are officially given for 1918 alone, while 99 are listed in only 20 provinces (constituting about a third of Bolshevik-controlled territory) in 7 months of 1919. And second, those dying as a result of prison and camp treatment. Together, these are conservatively estimated to have accounted for at least twice as many lives as the executions proper. If we put forward a total of 500,000 victims for the period we shall certainly be erring on the side of underestimation.21 It is, of course, true that — million of the most intransigent of the regime’s opponents had escaped into exile (and the executions in the Crimea, after the hasty final evacuation had left behind a particularly large concentration of bourgeois and white guards, was by far the most unrestrained of all the Bolshevik terror operations.)"""

# chamberlin's discussion (probably the best of all of the above)
Chamberlin 1935: discusses Latzis' estimates as severe underestimates: <https://www.worldcat.org/title/123764971> <http://library.lol/main/0F0C303AF60454A7A52DFB3366D9313B> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1072649903425192008/chamberlin1935.pdf> """M. Y. Latzis, a prominent Chekist, states " that 12,733 persons were shot in all Russia by the Cheka during the first three years of its existence, which would cover the whole period of the civil war. But there are very strong reasons for regarding this figure as a gross underestimate. The same Latzis, in another work,15 asserts that the Cheka, during 1918 and the first seven months of 1919, shot 8,389 people only in twenty provinces of Central Russia (my italics). Now there were other parts of Russia where the civil war was much more protracted and fierce than in Central Russia, and where the number of victims of terrorism must have been far greater. There was Ukraina, where the peasantry, being more well-to-do and more attached to the homestead system, fought much more stubbornly against Bolshevism than the poorer peasants of Central Russia. There was the Ural Territory, where, by general agreement, there was a savage struggle, marked by wholesale killings on both sides. There were the Don and Kuban Territories, strongholds of the White movement, where the dissatisfaction of the Cossacks certainly created an abundance of work for the local Chekas. Many Russians are convinced that the victims of BeIa Kun and Zemlyachka in the Crimea run into tens of thousands. There is certainly every probability that they were numbered in thousands.16 As has been pointed out, large-scale organized terror began only in July, 1918. With the Cheka admitting 8,389 executions in twenty provinces of Central Russia during the first year of a struggle that lasted for approximately two and a half years, and with the struggle often most bitter just in outlying parts of the country, it is simply impossible to believe that the Cheka only put to death 12,733 people in all Russia up to the end of the civil war."""
Chamberlin 1935: discusses his own estimate of 50,000 (~4000 were killed in 1 of 3 years of war in location with 1 of 5 people in Russia, so 4000*3*5=60,000): <https://www.worldcat.org/title/123764971> <http://library.lol/main/0F0C303AF60454A7A52DFB3366D9313B> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1072649903425192008/chamberlin1935.pdf> """While any estimate, in view of the lack of reliable data, must be highly conjectural and approximate, I should consider it probable that about fifty thousand persons were put to death in the course of the Red Terror during the period of the civil war. This, of course, would not include insurgents who were shot down with arms in their hands or people who were killed by mobs or by uncontrolled bands of soldiers and sailors. Some confirmation of the probability of my approximate estimate of fifty thousand as the number of persons put to death by the Cheka and definite refutation of Latzis's much lower figure are furnished by an interesting document in the possession of the Russian Foreign Archive in Prague. This document bears the title: "Otchet Tsentralnogo Upravlenie Chrezvichainnikh Komissii pri Sovnarkome Ukraini za 1920 God" (Report of the Extraordinary Commissions under the Council of People's Commissars of Ukraina for 1920) and was published in Kharkov in 1921. This report states that, during 1920, 3,879 persons were shot by the Extraordinary Commissions in Ukraina, the Odessa Cheka making the most sanguinary record with 1,418 executions and the Kiev Cheka following with 538. If almost four thousand persons are officially stated to have been put to death by the Cheka in Ukraina in one of the three years of civil war (Ukraina contains about a fifth of the population of the entire area affected by civil war), it would seem that fifty thousand is a reasonable and probably moderate estimate of the total number of victims of Red Terror."""

It was not supported by any documentary proof; and, on the basis of the available evidence, it would seem to be a wild exaggeration, just as the statement of Latzis, the Cheka official and apologist, is, in all probability, a substantial understatement. In general, it should be noted that, while an abundance of ghastly and revolting atrocities were certainly committed on both sides, Red and White authors alike, with a few exceptions, display a tendency greatly to exaggerate the numbers of persons killed by their opponents, while minimizing or glossing over the terroristic activities of their own side."""

The scope and violence of these assaults dwarfed the pogrom waves of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and with an estimated 50,000 Jews killed, these pogroms represented a greater degree of devastation than even the seventeenth-century rebellion under Bohdan Khmel’nyts’kyi (known as gzeyres takh vetat). Ukrainian forces, nominally under the control of Symon Petliura, perpetrated approximately 40 percent of the recorded pogroms. Although Petliura never ordered his forces to engage in such activity and eventually exhorted his troops to refrain from the violence, his initial reaction to the attacks in early 1919 was characterized by relative inaction. Jews widely regarded Petliura as the person principally responsible for the pogroms; his 1926 assassination in Paris by a Bessarabian Jew seeking vengeance made world headlines. Approximately 25 percent of the pogroms were perpetrated by “independents”—local hooligans and gang leaders who took advantage of the anarchy to despoil local minority populations. The White Army is associated with 17 percent of the attacks, and was generally responsible for the most active propaganda campaign against Jews, whom they openly associated with communism. The Red Army, under the direction of Leon Trotsky, was specifically charged not to attack Jewish populations, and indeed Soviet troops are blamed for only 9 percent of the pogroms. Furthermore, statistical evidence indicates that pogroms perpetrated by Red Army troops were milder in nature: whereas an average of 38 people were murdered in every Ukrainian pogrom, and 25 people per White Army pogrom, only 7 people were killed in the typical Red Army pogrom.

He asserts that detailed figures show 35,000 deaths and cites estimated numbers of victims in about thirty of the largest pogroms, totalling more than 10,000. E. Heifetz, chairman of the All-Ukrainian Relief Committee for Victims of Pogroms, in his book, "Material Gathered by the All-Ukrainian Committee for the Relief of Victims of Pogroms" (pp. 176ff.), first estimates that 15,000 were killed by Petlurist regular troops, an equal number by the leaders of guerrilla bands and 500 by Red troops, then characterizes this figure as an underestimate and suggests that the grand total of victims would show 70,000 killed by the Ukrainian nationalists and 50,000 by Denikin's forces. Quite probably these vague estimates of 100,000 or more victims are exaggerated.

They were specialists in guerrilla warfare and attacked both Reds and Whites. The most influential Green army was probably that led by the Ukrainian anarchist, Nestor Makhno, which at one point was thought to have numbered around 30,000 men. According to W.B. Lincoln, Makhno had a deep belief in an egalitarian revolutionary order. He was fighting for ‘a stateless communist society in which slavery will vanish and state authority will have no place, where the land belongs to nobody and it can be used only by those who care about it and cultivate it/ Makhno viewed Denikin as the greatest enemy, operating in the south - in the Ukraine, the Crimea and the Kuban - he and his partisan army did everything in their power to harass Denikin. They raided his ammunition dumps and destroyed vital reserves of shells just as he was about to launch his attack on Orel. They continued to attack his supply lines so successfully that Denikin was forced to detach troops to deal with them. An American pilot helping the Whites reported that 'Makhno was looting trains and depots with impunity, and White officialdom was losing what little control over the civilian population it had.’ In the end Makhno probably contributed as much to the defeat of Denikin as the Reds did.27"""

# de-cossackization: 10k to 500k
de-cossackization (may be included in the Red Terror): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Cossackization>
^ Despite there being more than a million Cossacks before 1917, very few people consider themselves Cossacks today.[7] Shane O'Rourke states that the de-Cossackization "was one of the main factors which led to the disappearance of the Cossacks as a nation".[7] Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, notes that "hundreds of thousands of Cossacks were killed".[20] Robert Gellately claims that "the most reliable estimates indicate that between 300,000 and 500,000 were killed or deported in 1919–20" out of a population of around three million.[19]
The process has been described by scholar Peter Holquist as part of a "ruthless" and "radical attempt to eliminate undesirable social groups" that showed the Soviet regime's "dedication to social engineering".[10] [....] Peter Holquist states the overall number of executions is difficult to establish; in some regions, hundreds were executed, while the tribunal was very active in Khoper, with a one-month total of 226 executions. The Tsymlianskaia tribunal oversaw the execution of over 700 people. The Kotel'nikovo tribunal executed 117 in early May and nearly 1,000 overall. Others were not quite as active. The Berezovskaia tribunal made a total of twenty arrests in a community of 13,500 people. Holquist also notes that some of White reports of Red atrocities in the Don were consciously scripted for agitation purposes.[21] In one example, an insurgent leader reported that 140 were executed in Bokovskaia, but later provided a different account, according to which only eight people in Bokovskaia were sentenced to death, and the authorities did not manage to carry these sentences out. Holquist emphasizes that he is "not seeking to downplay or dismiss very real executions by the Soviets". Overall, he estimates a death toll of around 10,000 from de-Cossackization.[9]

Chemin 31 October 1997 in Le Monde: Werth says Courtois had an "obsession with reaching one hundred million deaths"; for example, Werth suggested that the Soviet Union had 15 million victims, while Courteois added 5 (to reach 20 million) in his introduction; for another example, Margolin "never mentioned a million deaths in Vietnam" while Courtois puts the number at TODO: <https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/10/31/les-divisions-d-une-equipe-d-historiens-du-communisme_3811179_1819218.html> <https://web.archive.org/web/20200630105301/https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1997/10/31/les-divisions-d-une-equipe-d-historiens-du-communisme_3811179_1819218.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1091954935437987880/image.png [cannot find full text] """Jean-Louis Margolin et Nicolas Werth reprochent à Stéphane Courtois de considérer « la dimension criminelle comme l'une des dimensions propres à l'ensemble du système communiste », ainsi qu'il l'écrit dans son texte. « Cela revient à enlever son caractère historique au phénomène, affirme Jean-Louis Margolin. Même si le terreau communiste peut aboutir aux crimes de masse, le lien entre doctrine et pratique n'est pas évident, contrairement à ce que dit Stéphane Courtois ». Contestant des « approximations », des « contradictions » et des « maladresses qui font sens », les deux auteurs reprochent à Stéphane Courtois son « obsession d'arriver aux cent millions de morts ». Nicolas Werth décompte ainsi quinze millions de victimes en URSS, quand Stéphane Courtois, dans son introduction, en ajoute cinq. M. Margolin explique « qu'il n'a jamais fait état d'un million de morts au Vietnam ». Ce dernier avait déjà réussi, il y a quelques semaines, à imposer à l'éditeur un changement de titre (l'ouvrage devait s'appeler Le Livre des crimes communistes) et a imposé un sous-titre : Crimes, terreurs, répressions.""""""Jean-Louis Margolin and Nicolas Werth criticize Stéphane Courtois for considering “the criminal dimension as one of the dimensions specific to the entire communist system”, as he writes in his text. "This amounts to removing its historical character from the phenomenon," says Jean-Louis Margolin. Even if the communist breeding ground can lead to mass crimes, the link between doctrine and practice is not obvious, contrary to what Stéphane Courtois says”. Disputing "approximations", "contradictions" and "clumsiness that make sense", the two authors criticize Stéphane Courtois for his "obsession with reaching one hundred million deaths". Nicolas Werth thus counts fifteen million victims in the USSR, when Stéphane Courtois, in his introduction, adds five. Mr. Margolin explains “that he never mentioned a million deaths in Vietnam”. The latter had already succeeded, a few weeks ago, in imposing on the publisher a change of title (the work was to be called The Book of Communist Crimes) and imposed a subtitle: Crimes, terrors, repressions."""

In addition, tens of millions of “counterrevolutionaries” passed long periods of their lives inside the prison system, with perhaps 20 million dying there. To that total should be added the staggering number of deaths during the ill-named Great Leap Forward—estimates range from 20 million to 43 million dead for the years 1959-1961—all victims of a famine caused by the misguided projects of a single man, Mao Zedong, and his criminal obstinacy in refusing to admit his mistake and to allow measures to be taken to rectify the disastrous effects.

Whether out of fear of these people who so recently had been powerful or out of a sense of injustice, things often began very slowly, and the militants were forced to hurry things along a bit by physically beating and humiliating the accused. At that point the opportunists or those who bore a grudge against the accused would begin the denunciations and accusations, and the temperature would begin to rise. Given the tradition of peasant violence, the outcome was usually a death sentence for the landowner (accompanied by confiscation of all goods and possessions) and immediate execution with the active participation of the peasants.""""""There is no precise tally of the number of victims, but because there was necessarily at least one per village, 1 million seems to be the absolute minimum, and many authors agree on a figure of between 2 million and 5 million dead.51 In addition, between 4 million and 6 million Chinese “kulaks” were sent to the new laogai, and almost double that number were placed under observation for varying lengths of time by the local authorities, which meant constant surveillance, ever harder work, and persecutions in the case of any “mass campaign.”52 If we extrapolated from the number killed in Long Bow — 15 - we would arrive at the top end of the estimates. But the reform process started early there, and after 1948 some of the excesses of the previous period were banned. Long Bow had been hit extremely hard, with a massacre of the whole family of the president of the local Catholic association (and the closure of the church), beatings, confiscation of the goods of poor peasants who had shown solidarity with the rich, and a search for any “feudal origins” in the last three generations (which meant that almost no one was safe from some sort of reclassification).""""""51.

Shalom argues that Richard Walker’s estimate of the number of deaths due to Chinese Communist actions and policies is too high and needs to be adjusted downward. Shalom’s estimate of 2.5 million corvée laborers does not include the millions of PRC prisoners then doing forced labor either in camps or “under the supervision of the masses.” <https://worldcat.org/title/11011327> "The main original contribution of the book (unrelated to merely debunking other accounts) is his estimation of death rates in these camps. There is really no data on this, but Shalom discovers an ingenious way to make an estimate. We know how many "rightists" were arrested in the 1950s and how many were released in the 1970s. Even if one assumes that everyone who didn't die in prison was released then, the death rate is still much lower than that posited by propagandists. Of course, there were many survivors released earlier or later, and this group's death rate was probably higher than the average prison death rate as they were in during the GLF."

Among these, "712,000 counter-revolutionaries were executed, 1,290,000 were imprisoned, and 1,200,000 were subject to control at various times.

This figure was obviously much higher than the 0.1 per cent scale that Mao initially envisaged.

The Chinese Communist leadership had estimated that landlords and their families constituted 4—5 per cent of the rural population — about 20 million people.23 This would imply that 1 to 4 per cent of landlords’ families met death. If a half-million people were killed in land reform, this would be 0.1 per cent of the rural population or 2.5 per cent of the landlord class and would represent roughly one death in six landlord families.24"""

Warren W. Smith, a broadcaster of Radio Free Asia (which was established by the US government), extrapolated a death figure of 400,000 from his calculation of census reports of Tibet which show 200,000 "missing" people.[61][62] The Central Tibetan Administration claimed that the number that have died of starvation, violence, or other indirect causes since 1950 is approximately 1.2 million.[63] According to Patrick French, the former director of the London-based Free Tibet Campaign and a supporter of the Tibetan cause who was able to view the data and calculations, the estimate is not reliable because the Tibetans were not able to process the data well enough to produce a credible total. French says this total was based on refugee interviews, but prevented outsider access to the data. French, who did gain access, found no names, but "the insertion of seemingly random figures into each section, and constant, unchecked duplication."[64] Furthermore, he found that of the 1.1 million dead listed, only 23,364 were female (implying that 1.07 million of the total Tibetan male population of 1.25 million had died).[64] Tibetologist Tom Grunfeld also finds that the figure is "without documentary evidence."[65] There were, however, many casualties, perhaps as many as 400,000.[66] Smith, calculating from census reports of Tibet, shows 144,000 to 160,000 "missing" from Tibet".[67] Courtois et al. forward a figure of 800,000 deaths and allege that as many as 10% of the Tibetan populace were interned, with few survivors.[68] Chinese demographers have estimated that 90,000 of the 300,000 "missing" Tibetans fled the region.[69] The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) denies this. Its official toll of deaths recorded for the whole of China for the years of the Great Leap Forward is 14 million, but scholars have estimated the number of the famine victims to be between 20 and 43 million.[70]

Peter Kenez deflates an overblown polemic.""""""How good is this book as a work of history? This is a work by 11 different historians and, obviously, some of the chapters are better than others. My expertise is limited to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and therefore it is difficult for me to judge the chapters on Asian Communism. Perhaps because these stories were less familiar to me, I found the descriptions particularly shocking. Mr. Paczkowski, who wrote the chapter on Poland, immediately lost my confidence in his objectivity when he wrote on the second page of his essay: "In the summer of 1920, Lenin launched a Red Army offensive against Warsaw." It is not simply a matter of opinion, but a fact that it was Pilsudski, the Polish hero of independence, who attacked and the Red Army perhaps inadvisably, pursued the Poles. Nor can it be shown, contrary to Paczkowski, that the Stalinists had a unique hatred against Poles. Many other nationalities (Ukrainians, Jews, Chechens, Tatars, etc.) have claimed the same distinction. Stephane Courtois and Jean-Louis Panne used several pages in their article on the Comintern proving that that organization aimed at fomenting revolutions around the world. This was an easy task in view of the fact that fomenting revolution -- always laughably, inefficiently, and without success -- was the proudly proclaimed goal of that organization. These errors and imprecisions do matter, for they undermine the confidence of the reader in other figures that are not so easy to check.

We assumed, based on a variety of evidence, that these peak rates in North Korea occurred in both 1997 and 199810 (death rates in 2000 were presumed to match those of 1994, the year prior to the famine; the projection program interpolates values for unspecified years: 1995-96 and 1999).

The "official" figure 6 is derived by subtracting the crude death rate of the pre-famine year, 1957, from those of the famine years and multiplying the difference by the estimated size of the Chinese population. Peng's estimate of 23 million is based upon provincial vital statistics for 14 provinces, the assumption that their experiences were matched by the rest of China's (then) 29 provinces, and assumptions about underreporting. Banister's estimate of 30 million is based upon a computer reconstruction of population trends that assumes substantial underestimation of mortality both before and during the famine. [....] Ashton et al.'s figure of 29.5 million excess deaths results from a complex series of estimates based on mortality levels of children aged 10 and under derived from cohort survivorship rates, and on the assumption of greatly differing underreporting rates for children and adults. A peculiarity of the Ashton et al. procedure is that their estimate of baseline, normal child mortality for the famine period is based on the assumption of actual famine-level births and thus is too low. That is, if the famine had not occurred, fertility would have been much higher; applying estimated normal infant mortality rates to the larger number of births would generate a larger "normal" number of infant deaths. Excess infant deaths due to the famine (equal to actual infant deaths in the famine years minus the estimated "normal" number) would thus be fewer than Ashton et al. estimate. Their reason for adopting this procedure was to avoid having to count deaths of infants who were not in fact born. Yet the result is to exaggerate the number of excess deaths. This dilemma presents a good example of the complexity and ambiguities involved in estimating famine mortality. No matter what method they use, all students of the Chinese famine come up with an appallingly large loss of life. Is it quibbling or playing a numbers game to harp on whether the true figure is 15 million or 30 million? I would suggest that it remains important to construct as historically accurate an account as possible of the Great Leap Famine, and that a careful taxonomy of estimates, clearly setting out methodologies and assumptions of each, would help arrive at a consensus---or at least help to clarify differences."""

Still, a toll of 25 million is as plausible as one of 15 million. Either way, the Great Leap Famine still remains ahead of its nearest competitors.20 The immediate context of the famine was a severe harvest shortfall in 1959 followed by an even worse one in 1960, procurements of food from the countryside that made scant allowance for this, and massive economic dislocation due to the Great Leap Forward (see table 1). Policy-related factors listed in the specialist literature range from consumption and production inefficiencies associated with the soup kitchen regime and the people’s communes, and the fanaticism of local Party leaders, to the draconian grain procurements of the summer and autumn of 1959, and the economic costs of fast-track central planning.21 Moreover, as research on the political economy of famine suggests, much can be done to mitigate crises, even in the presence of severe supply shortfalls.22 Clearly the Chinese leadership ignored evidence of unfolding disaster at the Lushan Party conference of July 1959, and blamed the messenger in the person of Defence Minister Peng Dehuai. They continued to export grain, though at a diminishing rate, and failed to import significant quantities until 1961. They denied the very existence of famine, ruling out the option of foreign aid.23 Although the hostility of both the Soviet Union and the United States at this juncture were constraints, theCommunists still made the wrong political choices and were responsible for many millions of deaths.

The high rates of increase claimed for 1962-64 complicate the problem, because a backward projection based on the 1964 census figure and the official rates of natural increase produces a very low total for year-end 1961-under 642 million, or about 5 million less than the year-end 1957 total. If there was any population growth at all in 1958 and 1959-and there must have been an increase of at least 18 million during those years-the net loss in 1960-61 would have had to be no less than 23 million. However, the extreme rebound in the birth and natural increase rates in 1962 and 1963 needs to be reexamined. If the food shortages caused by the bad harvests of 1961 were still affecting the health and fecundity of women in the first half of 1962, the high 1962 and 1963 birth rates are not plausible. Perhaps a part of the apparent rebound in births in 1962 and 1963 was due to a delay in registering births during the crisis years because the famine had disrupted routine civil activities. If that is the case, the real rebound may not have been as early or as high as the official data show, and the losses during the crisis may not have been as acute as either the foregoing net loss estimates or the official crude death rate of 25.4 for 1960 would imply. The official vital rates of the crisis years must be estimates, but their basis is not known.

Excess infant deaths due to the famine (equal to actual infant deaths in the famine years minus the estimated "normal" number) would thus be fewer than Ashton et al. estimate.

Because the fertility of recorded women is likely to have been higher than those who were no longer living at the time of enumeration, and because the survival of children may be related to that of their mother, especially during the famine, results obtained from the sample may not represent what actually happened to the entire population during the famine.

^ Wemheuer 2011: review of Dikotter: Dikotter uses very basic math and assumes a very high underreporting rate to achieve his estimate of 45 million: <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/tcj.66.41262812> <https://sci-hub.st/10.1086/tcj.66.41262812> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1071646811707678720/dikotter2010.pdf> ""The question of how many people died as the result of the Great Leap still remains controversial. Based on official population surveys from the 1980s, Western and Chinese demographers have estimated that between 15 and 40 million people died. Dikotter argues that the minimum would be an excess mortality of 45 million (p. 33). It seems that his interest is in presenting the highest number possible, to label the Great Leap as the greatest mass killing in human history. He arrives at this figure based on discrepancies between the estimates of historian demographer Cao Shuji and data from some county security police reports. Basing his estimate on all available county gazetteers, Cao suggests excess mortality to be 32.5 million;20 Dikotter adds 40 to 50 per cent to official county statistics, and arrives at 45 million. The economist demographer Coimac O Grada has criticized this method as speculation.21 Furthermore, Dikotter does not present much evidence for his claim that 2.5 million people were beaten to death and 1 to 3 million committed suicide (p. 304). Instead of using local examples to speculate about the numbers on a national level, it would be better to accept that it is impossible to know how many people died during the famine, because the statistical system collapsed and it is very unlikely that the Central Party Archive will declassify its most sensitive documents as long the CCP remains in power. [....] We should not forget that the Great Leap was not the first famine in modern Chinese history, but the last in a historical cycle that started from the late Qing. The Chinese scholar Xia Mingfang estimates the victims of drought and floods between 1911 and 1948 at over 18 million people.2"""

In style and approach it recalls Jung Chang and Jon Halliday’s controversial Mao: The Unknown Story (2005); indeed, Chang leads the ”praise” for MGF on the back cover. MGF may become the best-known account of the GLF famine for a while. But should it? It is not a comprehensive account of the famine; it is dismissive of academic work on the topic; it is weak on context and unreliable with data; and it fails to note that many of the horrors it describes were recurrent features of Chinese history during the previous century or so. More attention to economic history and geography and to the comparative history of famines would have made for a much more useful book. In what follows I focus on the economic context of the famine, review features of the famine treated by Dikötter but worth further study, and conclude by discussing the role in these events of Mao and the party elite.""""""MGF is full of numbers but there are few tables and no graphs. Quantification is not its strong point. So we read that ”between 1 and 3 million people took their lives” by suicide during the GLF (p. 304); that in Xinyang in Henan province “67,000” people were clubbed to death by militias (pp. 117, 294); that in some unspecified location “forty-five women were sold to a mere six villages in less than half a year” (p. 261); that “at least 2.5 million…were beaten or tortured to death” during the Leap (p. 298); and that delays to shipping in the main ports during some unspecified period cost “£300,000” (p. 156). An estimate of 0.7 million deaths from starvation and disease in labor-correction camps between 1958 and 1962 is obtained by applying an arbitrary ”rough death rate” of two-fifths to a guess at the camp population at its peak (p. 289). The main basis for the claim that “up to two-fifths of the housing stock turned into rubble” (p. xii) seems to be a report describing conditions in Hunan province from Liu Shaoqi to Mao on 11 May 1959, after Liu had spent a month in the region of his birth (p. 169).2 On page after page of MGF, numbers on topics ranging from rats killed in Shanghai to illegal immigration to Hong Kong are produced with no discussion of their reliability or provenance: all that seems to matter is that they are ”big.”"""

From Western Europe to the United States to apartheid South Africa, prisons and their equivalents remained the punishment of choice. And these were not “liberal” institutions, but ones in which compulsory labor, corruption, beatings, and prisoner-on-prisoner violence abounded. Moreover, they were often places of severely curtailed rights and arbitrary rule. Some commentators from the period poignantly noted that prison systems in the West were in essence “totalitarian” islands in otherwise free societies. [....] This is not to defend the atrocities committed by and in the Gulag under Stalin and to a lesser extent under Khrushchev, which Solzhenitsyn masterfully exposes, but to remind that some of what he describes is endemic to prisons in general, not to Soviet institutions in particular."""

This certainly holds true in terms of the Gulag's permanent reduction in size, but it also applies to the reorientation of Gulag aims and the resultant improved conditions experienced by its inmates. Although certain inmate privileges were reduced or eliminated in the early 1960s at the culmination of the “camp is not a resort” campaign, many of the most important prisoner-friendly reforms of the 1950s, such as parole and the eight-hour workday, remained. Despite certain continuities, therefore, the Gulag did not return to a state of unchecked (and even abetted) violence, grueling labor, and oppressive living conditions—the defining features of the Stalinist penal system. De-Stalinization in the penal sphere was a real and enduring legacy of the Khrushchev era."""

I then use two instrumental variable strategies–a historical shift-share IV and a patent examiner leniency instrument–to estimate the impact of the decline in public R&D on the productivity of firms through spillovers. I find that a 1% decline in public R&D spillovers causes a 0.17% decline in productivity growth. Public R&D spillovers are three times as impactful as private R&D spillovers for firm productivity and their impact persists at the sector level. Moreover, smaller firms experience larger productivity gains from public R&D spillovers. I calibrate a model of growth with heterogeneous firms which suggests that the decline in public R&D can explain around a third of the decline in TFP growth in the US from 1950 to 2018, and half of the rise in size inequality between firms over the same period."""

Yet the results do not necessarily portray a straightforward, constant pattern between Democrats and Republicans that corroborates already existing ideological notions about the party platforms. For example, Democratic control of the government prompts increased spending for some agencies, such as NASA, EPA, DOC, and DOT, while prompting decreased spending in other agencies, such as NSF, USDA, and NIH. In fact, in terms of overall R&D funding, Republican presidents appear more eager to spend than their Democratic counterparts.

Gruss 2012: government is better at handling basic science because it is too risky for private businesses: <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6080/392> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1126/science.1221292> Driven by Basic Research """For business management it is risky, and given the long time periods required for practical benefit, not sufficiently profitable, for most companies to finance such curiosity-driven fundamental research. Instead, this basic scientific research must be adequately funded by governments, both to produce the skilled problem-solvers needed by the private sector and because the research results themselves deliver substantial benefits to the local economy. [....] Looking at these facts, it is clear that Europe and the United States (investing 2 and 2.8% of GDP, respectively) are gambling away opportunities if they do not improve their investments in R&D with an emphasis on basic research. Japan and Korea are already investing around 3.4% of GDP, and China and India are also gradually catching up. This allows these nations much more flexibility in the scope of their investments. Still more important, however, the global challenges that face us all will only be resolved with new knowledge yielded by basic research. We must explore new means of feeding nine billion people soon. We must find new ways to provide solutions to energy demand and climate change. We must discover how to maintain health in an ever-aging society. So the real question is not “Can we afford to invest in basic research?” It is “How can we afford not to?” Because, as Francis Bacon also wrote, “He that will not apply new remedies must accept new evils; for time is the greatest innovator.”"""
Casassus 2014: basic research funding has declined: <https://www.nature.com/news/put-focus-back-on-basic-research-say-science-unions-1.15817> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1038/nature.2014.15817> Put focus back on basic research, say science unions """An unrelenting political push towards economic returns and short-term targets for research is endangering scientists' academic freedom in many countries around the world, the leading French researchers' union has warned."""

Indirect social pressure is much more subtle, and does not directly alter the phenotype of the left-hander, but instead acts to make left-handers stigmatized, ostracized, and taboo, so that they find it harder to have offspring.

Subsequently, Bryden and I collaborated with Taha Amir in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Yokahida Ida in Japan, and we also put together larger Western samples (mainly Canada and the UK), and Indian samples. Of 17 850, 14 924, 4485, and 656 offspring in the West, UAE, India, and Japan, for whom p(L) was 11.5%, 7.5%, 5.8%, and 4.0% respectively, the odds ratios for the effect of having a left-handed parent were 2.11×, 2.23×, 3.18× and 3.57× respectively, which is the pattern expected from gene frequency differences. Geographical differences in the modern world seem therefore to be primarily genetic in origin, rather than due to differences in social pressure (or what I will refer to subsequently as “direct social pressure”)."""

# drinking culture: do lower legal drinking ages create better drinking cultures? no
DeJong Blanchette 2014: long-term effects: four studies, using variation in increases of Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) in the United States, suggest that raising the MLDA from 18 to 21 significantly reduced heavy drinking for current young adults and through those young adults' lifetimes; the nationwide 21 MLDA decreased heavy drinking by about 4%: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24565317/> <https://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsads.2014.s17.108> <https://sci-hub.ee/10.15288/jsads.2014.s17.108> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1217929624118624348/dejong2014.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1217926029897629896/image.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1217926059547431015/image.png Case Closed: Research Evidence on the Positive Public Health Impact of the Age 21 Minimum Legal Drinking Age in the United States """Working with several years of data from the Monitoring the Future surveys, O’Malley and Wagenaar (1991) demonstrated that high school seniors and recent high school graduates drank less when the MLDA was 21 and then continued to do so through their early twenties, after they had reached the legal drinking age. A more recent analysis of Monitoring the Future data by Carpenter and colleagues (2007) found that exposure to an age 18 MLDA was associated with a higher prevalence of youth drinking (2.9 percentage points) and a higher prevalence of heavy drinking (1.7 percentage points). The authors estimated that national adoption of the age 21 MLDA was responsible for decreases in both outcomes of approximately 4%. Plunk and colleagues (2013) examined data for past-year drinkers born between 1949 and 1972 from the 1991–1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES) and the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). They found that respondents who had been exposed to a lower MLDA as minors were more likely to report frequent heavy episodic drinking during the year before their survey interview, while also being less likely to report any past-year moderate drinking. At the same time, MLDA exposure did not affect overall drinking frequency or average alcohol consumption. The authors noted that the results were largely driven by men and those not attending college, perhaps because of alcohol being more readily available to underage college students. Norberg and colleagues (2009), working with data from the same NLAES and NESARC surveys, showed that adults exposed to an MLDA less than 21 years during the 1970s and 1980s were more likely several decades later to meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder or other drug use disorder, as defi ned by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Their analysis controlled statistically for state and birth-year fi xed effects, age at assessment, alcohol tax rates, and other demographic and social background variables. This result did not appear to be mediated by age at drinking initiation, leading the authors to state that their fi ndings are likely explained by the greater frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption among youths exposed to a lower MLDA."""

Subsequent EPAD surveys in the United States and Europe, plus similar surveys for the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children project, have also shown that lifetime and annual prevalence rates are much higher in Europe than in the United States (Beccaria and White, 2012). Prevalence rates for drunkenness are also lower in the United States. In 2011, 36% of U.S. tenthgraders reported having been drunk in their lifetime, 29% in the past year, and 14% in the past month, compared with 47%, 37%, and 17%, respectively, of European youth ages 15–16 (Beccaria and White, 2012). It should also be noted that, compared with other regions of the world, Europe has the highest per capita alcohol use, the highest percentage of deaths attributed to alcohol (about twice the worldwide percentage), the highest burden of disease (i.e., disability) related to alcohol, and the highest prevalence of alcohol dependence (Gilmore and Atkinson, 2010)."""

To conduct the analysis, the authors assumed that individuals who resided in their birth state at the time of death resided in their birth state when they were between ages 18 and 20. They found an increased risk of both homicide and suicide for adult women who were exposed to a lower MLDA and were legally permitted to drink when they were younger than ages 18–20.

Shkolnikov et al 1998: under Gorbachov's anti-alcohol campaign, homicide initially dropped by 40%; comparisons beyond 1984-1986 may be spurious due to changes in how the Soviet Union reported homicide: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X98001028> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00102-8> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1002743389567062166/shkolnikov1998.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1003070847881322587/unknown.png """Thus, the reversal due to the Gorbachev anti-alcohol campaign involved all types of violent deaths, but the subsequent negative changes were induced by different dynamics according to specific causes. Alcohol consumption is no longer the main explanation of Russian mortality from violence. Traffic accidents rose suddenly in 1988-1989 when the use of individual cars grew, and the safety of roads diminished. But rather quickly in the 1990s, the phenomenon ended as a result of the increasing difficulties with energy supplies. The homicide increase observed in 1988-1989 perhaps resulted from the shock of economic reforms and the decline in the standard of living, which, reinforced by the declining authoritative and police system, increased the opportunities for crime. However, such a hypothesis does not explain the slowdown observed in 1990-1991, when such difficulties had become even more intense."""
Shkolnikov and Nemtsov 1997: under Gorbachov's anti-alcohol campaign (quadrupled alcohol prices, banned alcohol in public, dramatically limited state production), consumption of alcohol declined by ~22%: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK233403/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1002743807793709136/unknown.png samogon = moonshine; adjustment method: """Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to look for an indicator of alcohol consumption other than sugar sales that is less sensitive to external influence. The ratio of accidental and violent deaths with alcohol present in the blood (VDA) to "sober" accidental and violent deaths (VDS) satisfies this condition. (Accidental poisonings by alcohol are excluded from VDA and VDS figures because in this case, alcohol causes death independently of other factors.)"""

Elder et al 2010: review of taxes and alcohol consumption: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735171/>
A 2006 study by Gruenewald and colleagues, for example, examined California hospital admission for assaults and found that assaults were more common in areas with many alcohol outlets that required offpremises consumption such as liquor stores than in areas with many outlets where alcohol is consumed on the premises, such as bars. In fact, Gruenewald et al. (2006) found that bar density increased the assault rate only in low-income poor communities and rural communities, but not in stable, wealthy communities.
A third approach for addressing concerns about omitted variables bias is to examine how the opening and closing of alcohol outlets affects crime rates. Teh (2008) employs this type of strategy in an event-study framework using data on liquor outlets in Los Angeles. Her empirical specifications include area fixed effects, which ease concerns about the time-invariant characteristics of neighborhoods that might affect both crime rates and the probability that a liquor store is located in the neighborhood. In her main specifications the effects of liquor availability are identified from liquor store openings and closings. She finds that both property and violent crimes increase immediately after an alcohol outlet opens, and these effects are larger in the immediate vicinity of the outlet and in low-income neighborhoods.

There were fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's toxicology report, Blackwell noted, and inquired why Baker had not listed those as the "top line" causes of death in his report. "The top line of the cause of death is really what you think is the most important thing that you think precipitated the death. Other things that you think played a role in the death but were not direct causes" appear in the "other significant conditions" part of the death certificate, Baker explained. "Mr. Floyd's use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint, his heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint," Baker said. They were items that may have contributed to his death but were not the direct cause, he said."""

# expert testimony: floyd died from neck depression, not fentanyl
Summary: George Floyd did not die from a fentanyl overdose; while fentanyl was in his blood, it doesn't appear that he was high on fentanyl at the time of death: <https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/30/facebook-posts/no-autopsy-doesnt-say-george-floyd-died-overdose/> <https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/oct/18/kanye-west/fact-checking-ye-who-denied-george-floyd-died-knee/>
Martin Tobin MD, critical care pulmonary specialist: Floyd died from low oxygen: "Mr. Floyd died from a low level of oxygen, and this caused damage to his brain that we see. And it also caused a PEA [pulseless electrical activity] arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop." <https://www.npr.org/sections/trial-over-killing-of-george-floyd/2021/04/08/985347984/chauvin-trial-medical-expert-says-george-floyd-died-from-a-lack-of-oxygen> <https://archive.ph/gu3dD> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1032438770340999358/unknown.png """Because Floyd continued to speak for the first nearly five minutes of being held down, Tobin said, "We know that his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive" during that time. But shortly after the five-minute mark, Tobin said, Floyd's leg can be seen moving, seemingly involuntarily. "That is when he has suffered brain injury," the doctor said. "We can tell from the movement of his leg that the level of oxygen in his brain has caused what we call a myoclonic seizure-type activity." Clinicians see patients suddenly extend or straighten their legs because of low oxygen levels affecting their brain, Tobin added. After Floyd's condition reached that point, Tobin said, Chauvin's movement of his leg away from Floyd's neck and airway would not have much of an impact. Tobin said he's aware that Floyd had preexisting medical conditions. But he concluded, "A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died.""""
Martin Tobin MD, critical care pulmonary specialist: Floyd did not die from fentanyl; his breathing was too fast and he never entered a coma: <https://www.npr.org/sections/trial-over-killing-of-george-floyd/2021/04/08/985347984/chauvin-trial-medical-expert-says-george-floyd-died-from-a-lack-of-oxygen> <https://archive.ph/gu3dD> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1032438385056415844/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/1032439582324686878/unknown.png """Tobin says that using his clinical skills, he was able to calculate Floyd's respiratory rate at 22, noting that in a roughly 19-second span of a police video, Floyd is seen breathing between seven and eight times as he lies on the street. "It's extremely significant," the doctor said, "because one of the things in this case is the question of fentanyl." If that opiate was affecting Floyd, he said, it would have dropped his respiratory rate to around 10 breaths. Asked by the prosecutor if he saw a depressed breathing rate in Floyd, Tobin replied, "No. It's normal.""""

Историк Каутский никогда не слыхал о том, что всеобщее избирательное право дает иногда мелкобуржуазные, иногда реакционные и контрреволюционные парламенты. Историк-марксист Каутский не слыхал о том, что одно дело — форма выборов, форма демократии, другое дело — классовое содержание данного учреждения. Этот вопрос о классовом содержании Учредительного собрания прямо поставлен и разрешен в моих тезисах. Возможно, что мое разрешение неверно. Ничто не было бы для нас так желательно, как марксистская критика нашего анализа со стороны. Вместо того, чтобы писать совсем глупые фразы (их много у Каутского) насчет того, будто кто-то мешает критике большевизма, Каутскому следовало бы приступить к такой критике. Но в том-то и дело, что критики у него нет. Он даже и не ставит вопроса о классовом анализе Советов, с одной стороны, и Учредительного собрания, с другой. И поэтому нет возможности спорить, дискутировать с Каутским, а остается только показать читателю, почему нельзя Каутского назвать иначе, как ренегатом.""""""Kautsky the historian fails to see this. Kautsky the historian has never heard that universal suffrage sometimes produces petty-bourgeois, sometimes reactionary and counter-revolutionary parliaments. Kautsky the Marxist historian has never heard that the form of elections, the form of democracy, is one thing, and the class content of the given institution is another. This question of the class content of the Constituent Assembly is directly put and answered in my theses. Perhaps my answer is wrong. Nothing would have been more welcome to us than a Marxist criticism of our analysis by an outsider. Instead of writing utterly silly phrases (of which there are plenty in Kautsky’s book) about somebody preventing criticism of Bolshevism, he ought to have set out to make such a criticism. But the point is that he offers no criticism. He does not even raise the question of a class analysis of the Soviets on the one hand, and of the Constituent Assembly on the other. It is therefore impossible to argue, to debate with Kautsky. All we can do is demonstrate to the reader why Kautsky cannot be called anything else but a renegade."""

It appears that Mr. Stanley McCaffrey, while talking platitudes about academic freedom and opportunity in the field of higher education, at the same time denies thP new Secretary of Education the opportunity to speak at this institution.

It is these institutions that shape and articulate “public opinion,” the limits of which few politicians can violate with impunity. Culture, Gramsci felt, is not simply the superstructure of an economic base—the role assigned to it in orthodox Marxism— but is central to a society. His famous battle cry is: capture the culture. Gramscians, of course, would have no chance whatever of “capturing the culture” if it weren’t for the spiritual estrangement of the artistic and intellectual classes. The culture, obligingly, might almost be seen as surrendering to the enemy without need of being captured, and what we are witnessing is certainly far less the result of a plot or conspiracy from outside than of a transformation from within."""

It relies on statistical trends to tell that awesome story. The twentieth century was the first century that could be measured in a systematic manner. Those who saw it coming included President James A. Garfield who, while still a congressman in 1869, observed in a speech to the U.S. House of Representatives: The developments of statistics are causing history to be rewritten. Till recently, the historian studied nations in the aggregate, and gave us only the story of princes, dynasties, sieges, and battles…. Now, statistical inquiry leads him into the hovels, homes, workshops, mines, fields, prisons, hospitals, and all other places where human nature displays its weakness and its strength. In these explorations he discovers the seeds of national growth and decay, and thus becomes the prophet of his generation. Alas, President Garfield was assassinated in 1881 and did not live to see much beyond the earliest flowering of his prescient observation. As it turned out, we never stopped hearing all about “princes, dynasties, sieges, battles,” as well as the other great historical anecdotes, personalities, and moments of the ensuing years: the Titanic; the Hindenburg; Elvis; Lindbergh; Challenger; December 7, 1941, and June 6, 1944; the Roaring Twenties; Einstein; Madonna; the Zapruder film; O.J.; and Monica. But, as Garfield surmised, we developed a second way of seeing history. During the twentieth century, Americans became the most energetic measurers of social life that ever lived. They measured everything that had been counted before, such as population and the size of the government’s territory and army. And they pioneered the measurement of facets of American life that had never been systematically counted before, such as crime, love, food, fun, religion, and work."""

Fall 1961: while it is untrue that Congo only had 16 people with college degrees (those were essentially PhD's), its population of 13.5 million had just 4,000 college graduates: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2294315> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.2307/2294315> """A first attempt at restating the case in something else than simply emotional propaganda terms was made by an American educational missionary, the Rev. John A. Ball, Director of the White Fathers Information Center, in the following communication addressed to the New York Times in January 1961: The American press has repeatedly stated that there are only sixteen college graduates among the Congo's population of 14,000,000. This is simply not true. The 417 native Congolese Catholic priests should certainly be considered as "college graduates" since they have followed the same course of study as is offered in any Catholic seminary. Furthermore, I am personally acquainted with several who have doctorate degrees from recognized universities. Actually, there are over 4,000 Congolese who have the equivalent of an American college education. The nowfamous "sixteen" are men who have university degrees corresponding to post-graduate studies in the United States.'4 It must be emphasized, however, that the figure of 4,000 college-educated Congolese is obviously cumulative. It nevertheless presents an order of magnitude that is at variance with the magical figure of "sixteen college graduates" that no doubt will be foreveremembered asthe sum total of Belgium's educational efforts in the center of Africa. In actual fact, even that figure was inaccurate by July 1960, for another fourteen graduates joined the 1959 class to form a total of thirty such graduates - equivalent to American graduate degrees."""

Mass purposive killings in terms of executions were probably in the order of one million and probably as large as the total number of recorded deaths in the Gulag. In this narrowest category of purposefully caused deaths, the situation is exactly the opposite to that generally accepted. Hitler caused the murder of at least 5 million innocent people largely, it would appear, because he did not like Jews and communists. Stalin by contrast can be charged with causing the purposive death of something in the order of a million people. Furthermore the purposive deaths caused by Hitler fit more closely into the category of 'murder', while those caused by Stalin fit more closely the category of 'execution'. Stalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation. It is only when we get into the broader categories of causing death by criminal neglect and ruthlessness that Stalin probably74 exceeds Hitler, but here we have to remember that the USSR was much larger than Germany and that death rates in the best of times had always been significantly higher in Russia than in Germany."""

There the Fiihrer Chancellery, the engine which drove the T4 apparatus, continued to select, transport, and process its victims, while local authorities determined the pace of the killing. Employing drug overdose and lethal injection as a more covert means of killing, the murderous machinery of Operation T4 continued to claim victims at several custodial institutions throughout the Reich until the arrival of Allied troops in the spring of 1945.

Of these, 35,224 were killed in 1940 and 35,049 in 1941. With 18,269 persons gassed, Hartheim killed the largest number of victims, followed by Sonnenstein with 13,720. But if we combine the 9,839 persons killed at Grafeneck with the 10,072 gassed at the successor institution of Hadamar, we get the even larger total of 19,911. Likewise, combining the 9,772 victims at Brandenburg with the 8,601 at the successor institution of Bernburg creates another large total of i8,373.165 (See table 5.3.) Postwar German prosecutors believed, however, that these figures were too small. Basing their calculations on all available documents and interrogations, they argued that T4 probably distributed the number of patients equally between the killing centers. They counted about 20,000 victims each for Hartheim and Sonnenstein, and also 20,000 each for Brandenburg combined with Bernburg and for Grafeneck combined with Hadamar. This provided a total of 80,000 patients killed, although they believed it probable that the actual figure was even higher.166""" see also Table 5.3

the Vrba-Wetzler report (compiled by escapee Slovak Jews) estimates that the crematoria of Auschwitz-Birkenau could handle 6,000 persons per day, 2,190,000 persons per year, and 5,913,000 persons over Auschwitz-Birkenau's 2.7 years of operation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrba%E2%80%93Wetzler_report> <https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-vrba-wetzler-report-auschwitz-protocols> At present there are four crematoria in operation at BIRKENAU, two large ones, I and II, and two smaller ones, III and IV. Those of type I and II consist of 3 parts, i.e.,: (A) the furnace room; (B) the large halls; and (C) the gas chamber. A huge chimney rises from the furnace room around which are grouped nine furnaces, each having four openings. Each opening can take three normal corpses at once and after an hour and a half the bodies are completely burned. This corresponds to a daily capacity of about 2,000 bodies... Crematoria III and IV work on nearly the same principle, but their capacity is only half as large. Thus the total capacity of the four cremating and gassing plants at BIRKENAU amounts to about 6,000 daily.
the instructions written by the cremation company: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab4-civilian-ovens-comparison/> "As soon as the remains of the bodies have fallen from the chamotte grid to the ash collection channel below, they should be pulled forward towards the ash removal door, using the scraper. Here they can be left for a further twenty minutes to be fully consumed . . . In the meantime, further bodies can be introduced one after the other into the chambers." - J.C. Pressac, "Technique & Operation..." page 136

testimony from lab manager James Roth: <http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html> I don't think the Leuchter results have any meaning. There's nothing in any of our data that says those surfaces were exposed or not. Even after I got off the stand, I didn't know where the samples came from. I didn't know which samples were which. And it was only at lunch that I found out, really, what the case involved. Hindsight being 20/20, the test was not the correct one to have been used for the analysis. He presented us with rock samples anywhere from the size of your thumb up to half the size of your fist. **We broke them up with a hammer so that we could get a sub-sample; we placed it in a flask, add concentrated sulfuric acid.** It undergoes a reaction that produces a red-colored solution. It is the intensity of this red color that we can relate with cyanide concentration. You have to look at what happens to cyanide when it reacts with a wall. Where does it go? How far does it go? **Cyanide is a surface reaction. It's probably not going to penetrate more than 10 microns. Human hair is 100 microns in diameter. Crush this sample up, I have just diluted that sample 10,000; 100,000 times. If you're going to go look for it, you're going to look on the surface only.** There's no reason to go deep, because it's not going to be there. Which was the exposed surface? I didn't even have any idea. **That's like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber that's behind it.** If they go in with blinders on, they will see what they want to see. What was he really trying to do? What was he trying to prove?

# summary
Romanov 2017: these reports were not published directly by the ICRC, but were actually published by the Bad Arolsen special registry office [Sonderstandesamt Bad Arolsen (SBA)]; the SBA mostly received its information from the International Tracing Service (ITS), which was run by the ICRC from 1955 to 2012 and is dedicated to providing death certificates requested by families of those killed in concentration and death camps with certified death cases [beurkundeten Sterbefälle], meaning cases where the person's death was actually recorded (most death camp killings were unrecorded, many camp records were destroyed, and not all families survived or requested certificates): <http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2017/05/rebutting-twitter-denial-most-popular.html#redcrossstats> <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderstandesamt_Bad_Arolsen> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arolsen_Archives_-_International_Center_on_Nazi_Persecution>

# confirmation of above from red cross
the ICRC confirmed this in 1975 in a letter written by Francoise Perret: "The figures cited by the author of the [Holocaust denial ]booklet are based upon statistics falsely attributed to us, evidently for the purpose of giving them credibility, despite the fact that we never publish information of this kind"; "Unfortunately, our delegates were not able to enter the camps until the very end of the war.": https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863270565191876618/xJCzhbc_d.png the "300,000" figure is referring to an erroneous article written by a Swiss holocaust denier
Patterns of Prejudice 1978: the ICRC confirmed this again in 1978 with an official publication decrying "false propaganda": <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1080/0031322X.1978.9969431> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/863271875710550026/0031322x.png """Consequently the ICRC considers it must make clear the fact that it has never published — or even compiled — statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it. The work of the ICRC is to help war victims, not to count them. In any case, how could its delegates have obtained data for such statistics? They were able to enter only a few concentration camps, and then only in the final days of the war. [....] The same propaganda scheme has recently been making use of other figures, namely the number of deaths recorded by the International Tracing Service on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed. Obviously this number bears no relation — though the authors of the propaganda pretend otherwise — to the total deaths in concentration camps; firstly because a considerable quantity of documentay material was destroyed before the departure of the Nazi administration, and secondly because many deaths were never recorded, such as those which occurred in the extermination camps where records were generally not kept."""

# reality: all estimates were made on projections until 1949
none of the almanac estimates before 1949 were based on new data. the almanac's revised estimate for population change 1939 to 1949 is -5,376,520: <http://archive.is/ZaYxK> <http://www.nizkor.org/features/denial-of-science/worldalmanac.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/566326914998992896/unknown.png """The difference between the 1938 and 1948 figures is thus 4,481,491. In 1949, however, the World Almanac gives a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.""""""Deniers consider one of their stronger arguments to be the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They claim that the 1940 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1949 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. In their view this makes it impossible that 6 million Jews died, even given an extremely high birth rate. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deliberate extermination of millions of Jews, cannot have happened.""""""In addition, rather than using more accurate census figures and other records, Holocaust deniers rely on a popular compendium whose methodology of assessment is unknown, and whose estimates have varied significantly. For example, the 1982 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 14,318,000, while the 1990 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 18,169,000, and the 1996 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 13,451,000. Either 3.7 million Jews appeared unnoticed between 1982 and 1990, and then 4.5 million Jews disappeared equally unnoticed between 1990 and 1996, or the World Almanac is not a particularly reliable source for accurate estimates of worldwide Jewish population.""""""This subjectivity, commonly stemming from biases or selectivity of available sources, usually means that Holocaust deniers often ignore the documents produced by the Nazis themselves, who used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the Wannsee Conference. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the Korherr Report, which gave the status of the Final Solution through December, 1942: The total number of Jews in the world in 1937 is generally estimated at around 17 million, thereof more than 10 million in Europe... From 1937 to the beginning of 1943 the number of Jews, partially due to the excess mortality of the Jews in Central and Western Europe, partially due to the evacuations especially in the more strongly populated Eastern Territories which are here counted as off-going, should have diminished by an estimated 4 million. It must not be overlooked in this respect that of the deaths of Soviet Russian Jews in the occupied Eastern territories only a part was recorded, whereas deaths in the rest of European Russia and at the front are not included at all.... On the whole European Jewry should since 1933, i.e. in the first decade of National Socialist German power, have lost almost half of its population."""

# debunk: diesel engines were used, not gasoline

# sobibor testimony
Sobibor: one gasoline, one diesel (unused) <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> SS men Franz Hödl and Erich Fuchs were in charge of installing, maintaining, and operating the gas chamber engine at the Sobibor death camp. Fuchs specifically stated that the engine used at Sobibor was a gasoline engine: “We unloaded the motor. It was a heavy Russian petrol [gasoline] engine (presumably from a tank or tractor engine) of at least 200 HP (V-engine, 8 cylinder, water cooled).”[2] Likewise, Hödl also confirmed that there was a gasoline engine at Sobibor: “In the engine room there were indeed two engines. There was a petrol engine, probably from a Russian tank, and a diesel engine. The latter [the diesel engine] was never used, however.”[3]

# belzec testimony
Belzec: one gasoline: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> We have no testimony from the SS men who used the engine at Belzec. Kurt Gerstein, the SS officer who visited the camp in August 1942, described the engine as a diesel engine. However, he does not say how he knew what type of engine it was, so his testimony is less than conclusive. However, another eyewitness did see and interact with the engine at Belzec. Rudolf Reder was one of just two Jewish survivors from the 450,000 or more Jews murdered at Belzec. In 1944, Reder made a statement to the Central Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland regarding the engines used at Belzec. He described the engine as a “motor pedzony benzyna [gasoline-powered motor].” Reder also said that he carried 4 to 5 cans of petrol (gas) (kanistry benzyny) every day to the motor room of the gas chambers. Reder used the Polish word for gasoline (benzyny/benzyna) not diesel, which is ‘olej napedowy.’[4] Reder’s testimony indicates that the engine at Belzec was also probably a gasoline engine.

# treblinka testimony
Treblinka: one gasoline: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> There is one direct eyewitness who actually used the engine at the Treblinka death camp: Nikolay Shalayev. He was one of the so-called Treblinka “motorists.” He testified: “It was an ordinary, four-cylinder engine which used gasoline and, according to the story of the German machine operator, was of Russian make.”[5] As one of the operators of the engine, his evidence indicates that the engine used at Treblinka might have been a gasoline engine as well.

# debunk: no flaming chimneys

Romanov 2006 in HolocaustControversies: yes, chimney soot can produce flames -- as arch-denier Carl Mattogno admits: <http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.com/2006/07/ugly-voice-productions-and-holocaust.html> <https://archive.is/rNlUY> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/862076146384371752/unknown.png """In pre-war times, when the average European household was using wood, coke, or coal almost exclusively for home-heating, such cases were so common that the phenomenon was, on occasion, produced intentionally for scientific studies. For instance, in early 1933, such experiments were carried out in a nearly abandoned four-story building in Berlin. A diagram shows that 95 minutes after the ignition of the soot on the first floor one meter above ground level the combustion temperature of the soot in the smokestack reached 1060°C. This is not really surprising, for soot consists of carbon having an ignition temperature of 700°C."""

Writte 2001: deportations listed in the Hofle Telegram line up well with survivor reports: <https://academic.oup.com/hgs/article/15/3/468/660291> <https://sci-hub.ru/10.1093/hgs/15.3.468> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/859720445161635840/writte2001.pdf> """A transport from the collection camp Kielbasin is documented, starting on December 14, 1942 and arriving on December 15 at Treblinka, allegedly carrying 7,000 Jews to their death. If their arrival at Treblinka actually took place a day or two later (entirely possible as the date is an estimate), the deportation would fit into the "fortnightly report" of the document. On December 17, 1942, a train left Treblinka via Bialystok to Grodno, presumably to return fully laden again. According to survivor testimony, the last train from Kielbasin left for Treblinka on December 20.21 Whereas Treblinka murdered 10,335 victims in the second half of December 1942, for Sobibor only 515 are recorded These Sobibor Jews must be identical with those ascertained by Scheffler, who listed one deportahon to Sobibor from Staw on December 22, 1942. Details on this deportation emerge from die reports of survivors. It has to be stated diat the number 515 accords well with the sources."""

^ 26 June 1944: no open-air cremation can be seen because the camp received no large deportations before this photo: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab6-open-air-burning/> """John Ball, a Canadian Holocaust denier, argues that an aerial reconnaissance photograph taken by the Allies on June 26, 1944, when the Allies flew over Auschwitz-Birkenau on their way to bombing factory targets, showed no open-air burning pits.[8] This is because the deportation of Hungarian Jews was suspended during this time. The list of transports shows that no trains left Hungary from June 17 to June 24, but were resumed on June 25. The transports took three or four days to get to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Many Hungarian Jews were literally en route to their deaths. In addition, there was no evidence of Hungarian Jews being registered into the camp as slave laborers from June 20 to June 27, 1944, which again proves the suspension of activity."""

# photographs: liepaja massacre: unknown author
todo: <http://ellekar.dk/Media/35/Uddrag_35.pdf> """Mass shooting of Jews from Liepāja in Latvia. Most of the approximately 6,000 Jews from Liepāja were murdered in the second half of 1941 - most on 16 and 17 December on a beach north of the city. The killings were carried out by Einsatzgruppe A as well as Latvian auxiliary police. Along the coast a wide grave had been dug. The Jews were lined up in groups of ten on the edge of the tomb; the executioners - two for each victim - were located on the opposite side of the grave.

They can be turned off anytime. Even deep hobbies cannot be turned off so readily as politics. If one of those airplane craftsmen in the factory in Sheboygan called it quits or if Clayton was expected to be at a ham radio mountain retreat but bailed out at the last minute, other participants would be disappointed, hurt even. If he didn’t show, they’d call him up and find out where he was. In shallow hobbies, we are emphatically not being relied upon. When people quit Facebook, nobody likely calls them up or sends an email to convey concern or disappointment that they are no longer offering their political hot takes. The relationships are not serious enough that anyone would care to make such a call. That no one is relying on you is a great sign that the activity you are doing is a shallow hobby"""

The way we spend our free time affects how we participate in democracy. In a bowling league or at church, we get to know people in our communities.

This cause and effect is obvious to the National Rifle Association, which supports local clubs across the country, building community and training local leaders, offering services such as gun-safety classes and insurance.

They placed much less emphasis on bread-and-butter economic issues facing the working class, on economic inequality, on job training. When the time came for actions on issues that liberals cared about, such as the environment, the organizations felt hollow. As one John Kerry staffer told the sociologist Dana Fisher in 2004, in reference to national advocacy groups, “None of these organizations can actually produce two bodies … when they need to.” 22 In 2012, when Skocpol, joined by Vanessa Williamson, assessed the growing Tea Party movement, they were struck by the well-organized meetings and volunteers willing to roll up their sleeves and take on all the logistical headaches of running local groups. This felt different from their experience on the left. “Opinionated, educated liberals,” they write, “often have no idea what happens in state legislatures, local government boards, or political party committees. Grassroots Tea Partiers, by contrast, know the rules and procedures for passing bills and advancing regulations in detail—for local, state, and national government.” 23 Tea Party groups were often short-lived local organizations that withered away by the end of the Obama era. For some activists, participation was surely motivated more by short-term hobbyism, news obsession, and conspiracy theories than by a commitment to long-term power. Nevertheless, when the groups were strong, they were committed to the logistics and rules of power acquisition. They got off their couches and into the weeds of bottomup leadership. 24"""

While nonwhite Americans, particularly those in the middle and upper classes, can engage in political hobbyism as much as anyone else, research on racial politics suggests some important differences in minority communities that should limit the phenomenon. Namely, no matter how economically or professionally successful, black voters tend to see their own fate, and the fate of their families, as tied to the fate of the racial group as a whole. To a lesser extent this pattern is visible among Latinos as well. 8 The idea of linked fate may be the best explanation for why racial minorities, blacks especially, tend to be unified politically even though they exhibit internal diversity in wealth or religiosity or other traits that are predictive of political divisions among whites.

In a competitive area such as North Meck, Drew said, volunteers should focus not on one-off events and independent organizations, but on building sustainable Democratic committees. If folks start these groups within the structure of the Democratic Party, they get resources from the party that they couldn’t otherwise get, such as access to the national Democrats’ voter database and computer system, which the state party pays for and shares with its local affiliates. Plus, a sustained organization gives volunteers time to meet neighbors and form deeper relationships with voters than they otherwise could do from one-off volunteering.

They host forums, debates, discussions, all on campus, away from the political world around them. And they order pizza. And these are some of the most engaged students on campus. Greg and Drew thought a local precinct organization with students in leadership positions could draw students in a way that existing political organizations could not.

Angela comes back to those memories of Wisconsin rallies. “You need to have conversations with people who aren’t already convinced. At rallies, you might think you’re drawing attention, but your snarky signs aren’t going to persuade anyone.” But in an area where liberals were in hiding, lonely at home and in church, demonstrations served the specific purpose of recruitment. Angela and her team would stand in that plaza next to the court, her kids in a carrier and in a stroller, and new allies would approach them, just like how the first small group found Angela in the same plaza. Between the heckling yells from afar of “Build that fucking wall!” a few people would come over and write down their contact information. They would start coming to monthly meetings. The VOW contact list started to grow.

She joined them a few times, but she had mixed feelings about it. It was good to see people who cared and were excited to be involved. But the focus on protests reminded her too much of what hadn’t worked in Wisconsin. “Constantly calling or standing outside your congressman’s office or the Women’s March, is that long-lasting? They have funny signs, but so what? I saw that in Wisconsin. That stuff doesn’t work.” 2

The local congressman, Republican Tim Murphy, who had been in office since 2003, was caught having an affair. 3 Text messages revealed that this antiabortion legislator had asked his extramarital partner to have an abortion. He resigned from office in the fall of 2017. A special election was called. VOW got volunteers to knock on doors in their ultraconservative area on behalf of the Democratic candidate. That candidate, Conor Lamb, won by 755 votes in February 2018.

For the retirees, VOW became a primary social scene. For young families, too. They call the kids running around the meetings the VOW cousins. Community begets good deeds. VOW doesn’t talk about this part, would never brag about it. They take care of their growing community of friends and neighbors. Angela has driven undocumented immigrants in her VOW community to doctors’ appointments. Some are too afraid of being deported if they get pulled over that they won’t drive at all, even to the doctor’s. One woman in the community was about to be evicted from her home, and the group quickly came to her assistance. When the federal government shut down in 2019, the group chipped in for gas cards and diapers to help those not making ends meet. All quietly and behind the scenes. “This is the most powerful thing I’ve ever done,” Angela says about creating VOW. “It’s the thing I feel called to do.”

The movement failed, according to several scholars, because it lacked durable party organizations. In Egypt, for instance, protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square spurred elections, which was a major victory—after a mere eighteen days of protest, the country’s leader of almost thirty years stepped down. But the secular movement in Tahrir Square had no leaders, no ability to organize, and no capacity to mobilize voters. The liberal energy that spurred change lost the elections to an organized party, the right-wing Muslim Brotherhood, which was eventually forced out of power by a military coup. Activists with an Internet connection could crumble a government but could not build one in its place. 9 To do that, you need a hierarchy of leaders from low-level people willing to knock on thirty-five doors to middle-level organizers to higher-level leaders with a plan. In short, you need an organization. In Egypt, the protesters never had that."""

And to the surprise of reformers, most voters didn’t take any interest in primaries. They would vote in general elections but didn’t care to weigh in on the party nominations. 17 That’s true even today; only a fraction of general-election voters participate in primaries for state and local offices. Critics of primaries were also uneasy that high-profile candidates who hadn’t proven themselves as stewards of a party’s values could swoop in and dominate. In his Pulitzer Prize–winning account of this era, Richard Hofstadter argued that by creating two campaigns (a primary and a general) instead of one, primary reform increased the influence of money and celebrity without many benefits in terms of candidate quality or citizen participation. 18"""

The data also showed long, clear gradients between all of the clusters, and no unambiguous way to say where one cluster ends and another begins. Without sharp boundaries between these population structures, instead it showed continuity between people. This, as Johann Gottfried von Herder had suggested, was because human variation will not succumb to an imposed artificial taxonomy, but instead reflects history. Rosenberg’s paper is often used by racists to erroneously claim that there are indeed five genetically distinct races. In fact, it does no such thing, and this is obvious in the data: when the clusters are set at two, Africa, Europe and West Asia are lumped together as one and the rest of the world as another. There is no a priori reason to settle on five clusters as being the definitive categorisation of humans, and deciding to do so because it corresponds with an earlier yet debunked classification is simply affirming pre-existing biases. When you increase the cluster number to six, the next distinct group to emerge are the Kalasha.

What that means is that even if the differences and similarities in DNA make useful proxies for predicting the populations from which they were sampled, they don’t necessarily correlate with the traditional categories of race, as determined primarily by pigmentation. This type of analysis is totally valid, and is the basis for studying human history, migration and genetic variation between populations and people. We could keep increasing the number of clusters and find ever more precise similarities and overlaps. When even higher resolution genetic mapping was applied to the people of Britain in 2015, families who had lived in Devon for multiple generations could be distinguished from the people of Cornwall, and when these precise differences were plotted on a map the boundary was the River Tamar, which for centuries has effectively been the county line. When the same technique was applied to the Iberian Peninsula in 2019, it showed vertical stripes of similarity, revealing that Spain’s history meant that people are fractionally but measurably more similar in a north–south axis than they are east to west. Are they functionally different? Of course not, it’s simply that we have become so good at identifying the genetic histories of populations that we can pick up these wispy, diaphanous traces of similarity and difference. We could eventually cluster all humans into 7 billion individuals, because every human genome is unique."""

This is a truth universally acknowledged for all humans through time: a new whole genome is forged at the conception of a child. But the process of genetic shuffling that occurs in the formation of sperm and egg guarantees that each one of those two cells is unique and carries a unique half genome (therefore a unique half is lost in subsequent generations, should that sperm or egg be successful). Which means that not the same half gets transferred each generation. Over the generations, descendants begin to shed the DNA of their actual ancestors. The amount that vanishes is cumulatively huge: you carry DNA from only half of your ancestors eleven generations back. Genealogy and genetic genealogy are not perfectly matched, and progressively grow apart as we go back in time. It is therefore possible that you are genetically unrelated to people from whom you are actually descended as recently as the middle of the eighteenth century.

# against adaptationism
Rutherford 2020: "adaptationism" assumes that different genes frequencies in different populations must have been selected for; but this is an invalid assumption, due to genetic drift and the neutral hypothesis (which allows a large degree of divergence in frequency of genes with no strong effect, among other facts): <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """These are fractionally more sophisticated versions of the evolutionary crime we call adaptationism* – the assumption that natural selection is responsible for specific human behaviours, rather than happenstance or processes that are neither positive nor negative, but have simply drifted into existence. In the genomic age we are capable of actually seeing the parts of the genome where selection has taken place, and there are population-specific mutations that indicate positive selection of particular genes as adaptations to the local environment. Pigmentation, specific diets, resistance to diseases (such as malaria) and other traits are demonstrably local adaptations that are part of humankind’s success in colonising the world. Adaptationism is an error because in many cases it results in untestable hypotheses, but ones that are appealing because they sound superficially convincing – blacks are good sprinters because of selection during slavery; Jews are intellectually gifted because their history of persecution enriched genes associated with brains."""

# brief summary of how gwas works and why it can't alone demonstrate causality
Rutherford 2020: GWAS examines the aggregate effect on a measured phenotype of every gene, which enables us to identify genes with high influence and to estimate the overall summative effect of genes on phenotype: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """Understanding population genetics, however, is important for scientific arguments about race, so buckle up, and I’ll be brief. For really complex human traits, where thousands of minuscule differences seem to have small but cumulative effects, aggregating them helps us pool the genetic influence. This is known as a polygenic risk score (PRS). It’s a metric that allows us to estimate the total genomic underpinning of a trait: when the outcome of a GWAS is many genes, totting up their effect is handy. It is a powerful instrument, and a valuable addition to the scientist’s toolkit. Polygenic scores help us to understand the genetics of any human trait, including complex diseases, though not yet with enough detail to warrant clinical intervention. GWAS and PRS are truly brilliant tools that have utterly transformed the field of human genetics. That does not mean that they are infallible as tools, nor that they are always the most appropriate tools."""
Rutherford 2020: polygenic scores (PGS or PRS) merely demonstrate that a specific gene is *associated with* a specific phenotype, not that that gene *causes* or *helps to cause* that phenotype: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """Polygenic scores potently affirm that intelligence is heritable within a population. But this is a tool that is not particularly adept at dissecting the differences between populations. So when we see different IQ scores in different populations, and we know that the heritability of intelligence is high (more than 50 per cent), that doesn’t mean necessarily that the different DNA variants account for the differences between the populations. It would be perfectly possible for two populations with different sets of genetic differences to get the same IQ scores. Take height again, as it is easier to measure and better understood: the many differences in DNA that go some way towards accounting for the differences we see in heights in a population are not genes for height, only ones associated with height. We don’t know what those genetic signatures do, whether they are influencing height or just are physically linked to genes that are important for height, and are going along for the ride due to the way DNA is chopped up when sperm or eggs are made. We also don’t know if the genetic differences are dependent on the local environment to drive the phenotype and make the average taller. We might expect to see different genetic associations in Europe compared to Japan when looking at height, but without knowing what those genes do, we can’t know whether they have drifted into being, are significant, or are really meaningful in different environments, with different food or nutrition. These are not questions that this type of genetic study can answer well. GWAS are important and powerful for finding genes of relevance within a population – but not between different populations. This, I will not dispute, is difficult technical science and statistical analysis. But it is important in the ongoing discussions about intelligence and race. We get better at forensically unpicking groups of people, and the tools become easier to deploy. That doesn’t mean the tools are the right ones for the job. Scientists studying human variation, and journalists and readers need to be wary of drawing wrong conclusions from right results. Since the birth of the GWAS, results have frequently been vastly misreported: weak correlations claimed as causes, typically in the format ‘scientists discover the gene for X’. With the development of the polygenic score on top of the GWAS, we run the risk of further overinterpretation, or outright error."""
Rutherford 2020: the proper question for scientific racists and hereditarians is not whether a specific gene correlates with a specific outcome, but whether evolution selected for that gene -- without large differential selection, we would not expect large differences in genes, just lots of random genetic drift: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """When trying to account for disparities in intelligence, we not only need to bear in mind the limitations of the tools to hand, but also the reasons we attribute to our observations.

Maybe selection during slavery is the biological difference between over-representation of African American athletic success compared to African. Let’s leave aside the lack of support for that idea from generational time, and the absence of evidence for selection in the genome, as mentioned above. Let’s pretend that the genes being selected relate to power and strength, and by extension, that translates into a sprinting advantage, even though slave breeding programmes were not for fast running. Why then do Eastern Europeans dominate weightlifting, and are absent in sprinting, when slavery selection for power would be perfectly attuned to this sport, much more so than running? Why do African Americans dominate in boxing, but not wrestling? Why is it that a game such as squash, which also requires explosive energy and power, is dominated by athletes from India, Pakistan, Egypt and Great Britain, and has never featured a successful person of African descent? Why are there no African American sprint cyclists?"""
Rutherford 2020: in particular, we should expect that African people would dominate tennis through explosive energy -- but sports are mostly a social phenomenon, and one that black people have been excluded from until recently: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """Tennis is a sport requiring strength and explosive energy, yet people of West African or any African descent are largely absent from this sport of privilege. With twenty-three Grand Slam titles (and an additional sixteen in doubles), the dominance of Serena Williams in modern tennis puts her as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and indeed one of the greatest sportspeople of all time. Is Williams’ success a result of her ancestry? Yes, in a narrow sense, in that her assumed genetic make-up bestows part of her advantage. But the question is this: is her ancestry the defining characteristic of her success? That a black woman is a true great is partially a reflection of the lowering of prejudice and raising of opportunity in the modern era. By being one of the greatest tennis players of all time, just like Usain Bolt is the fastest runner ever recorded, they are already wonderfully freakish outliers and poor representatives of normal humans. Are they outliers genetically? For sprinting, there is a notable and blindingly obvious fact that is forever ignored. African American, Caribbean and African Canadian athletes have dominated sprinting for forty years, all descended from the enslaved from West Africa. Only five white men have competed in the Olympic 100 metres finals since the starting pistol was fired in the 1980 race, and the gold and bronze in that race are the only medals not won by black 100 metres sprinters. In that same time, the number of African men in the finals is also five. This includes two medals, both won by Frankie Fredericks from Namibia, a country that is not considered West Africa (rather it is south-west Africa); only one of the five Africans logged a time less than 10 seconds. By this metric, African men are precisely as successful as white men. The transatlantic slave trade also imported millions of West African women and men to South America. The number of South Americans of any ancestry to have competed in the 100 metres finals? Zero. The point is this: elite sprinters in the Olympics are not a dataset on which a statistician could draw any satisfactory conclusion. Yet it is precisely the data on which an extremely popular stereotype is based. The idea of black athleticism in sprinting is drawn from a hugely skewed and fatally flawed sample, one which due to the relative absence of West African sprinters doesn’t even support its own hypothesis. If people of West African ancestry have a genetic advantage, why are there few West African sprinters, when slavery does not account for the difference?"""

Rutherford 2020: Jewish people may have been overrepresented in certain jobs -- but those jobs were not intensely cognitively demanding, and any stronger claims demand strong evidence: <https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1228315214> <https://u1lib.org/book/5406846/1a86f7> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/736771760371793940/rutherford2020.pdf> """Though antisemitism is thousands of years old, and Jewish associations with intellectual pursuits are centuries old, much of the current discourse on supposedly innate Jewish cognitive abilities stem from a single study in 2006. In a paper that has had significant influence – and initiated much scrutiny – Gregory Cochran, Jason Hardy and Henry Harpending* suggested that the history of Ashkenazi Jews in Europe had the effect of enriching genes associated with intellect. They propose a number of factors unique to Jewish (and specifically Ashkenazi) history that created these favourable conditions for intellectual selection. These include social behaviours, such as endogamy, meaning that they mostly interbred, which created a gene pool which is favourable to natural selection. And ‘they had jobs in which increased IQ strongly favoured economic success, in contrast with other populations, who were mostly peasant farmers’. ‘Winnowing through persecution’ is another suggestion in the paper – somehow, acts of oppression and tyranny resulted in survival of the smartest. The authors, however, are clear in the paper that they can’t explain how that would work, as no such effect is seen in other persecuted people. I find it most strange that you include such guesswork in a scientific study. In response to the assertion that professions involving commerce require high levels of intellect, I am unaware of strong evidence that success in business correlates with significantly above average intelligence. Cochran et al. describe moneylending and other forms of commerce that are presumed to be the preserve of Jews as ‘cognitively demanding jobs’ and that ‘the Ashkenazi niche was so specifically demanding of accounting and management skills’. Presenting this as evidence also sounds pretty sketchy to me. Medieval moneylending is not exactly rocket science and it’s definitely not medieval brain surgery. They also cite specific biological factors and ‘physiological effects that could increase intelligence’. In the ancient days of 2006, we knew less than we do today about neuroscience, and how biochemistry in cells relates to thought and action – but not that much less. Neuroscience is a vibrant field, but the truth is that we still really have very little idea of how neuronal growth and connectivity relates to cognition. If I have succeeded in convincing you that genetics is bewilderingly complicated, apply that to the development of the physical brain and the esoteric nature of thought, and you face one of the great frontiers in science. The suggestion is that some disease genes have specific effects on the growth of neurons, in a way that might enhance IQ. But this reflects a profoundly simplistic view of neurological development."""

But the argument is riven with antisemitic tropes that are ahistorical. Moneylending is a common stereotype, not least because of Shakespeare’s Shylock. In fact, moneylending was a trade that was extremely limited in time and space within Jewish culture in Europe, and by the end of the fifteenth century had largely vanished from Jewish populations. Yet the implication of Cochran et al.’s scientific speculation is that business and financial acumen has driven the evolution of Jewish brains."""

There are databases that list hundreds of GWAS results and thousands of genes. You can enter a gene and ask the database to pull out studies that indicate the gene is associated with any one of dozens of types of trait, from height to mortality to bones, as well as cognitive and neurological.

Confronted by slavery and colonialism, they skimmed over history and culture, preferring instead to look to biology for justification for this kind of exploitation. When researchers like Meisenberg today link economic development to intelligence, they imply that the vast inequality between the world’s richest and poorest countries is rooted not just in the imbalance of power or historical circumstance, but in the innate weaknesses of the populations themselves.

One team of scientists claimed that the tiny peppering of Neanderthal DNA may have given Europeans different immune systems from Africans. Another published paper linked Neanderthal DNA to a whole host of human differences, including “skin tone and hair color, height, sleeping patterns, mood, and smoking status.” An American research group went so far as to try to link the amount of Neanderthal DNA people have with the shape of their brain, implying that non-Africans may have some mental differences from Africans as a result of their interbreeding ancestors. For more than a century the word “Neanderthal” had been synonymous with low intelligence. In the space of a decade, once the genetic link to modern Europeans was suspected, that all changed. In the popular press, there was a flurry of excitement about our hitherto undervalued relatives. Headlines proclaimed that “we haven’t been giving Neanderthals enough credit” (Popular Science), that they “were too smart for their own good” (The Telegraph), that “humans didn’t outsmart the Neanderthals” (Washington Post). Meanwhile a piece in the New Yorker whimsically reflected on their apparent everyday similarity to humans, including the finding that they may have suffered from psoriasis. Poor things, they even itched like us. “With each new discovery, the distance between them and us seems to narrow,” wrote the author. In the popular imagination, the family tree had gained a new member. In January 2017 the New York Times ran a story headlined “Neanderthals Were People, Too” and asked, “Why did science get them so wrong?” This was indeed the big question. If the definition of “people” had always included archaic humans, then why should Neanderthals so suddenly and so generously be accepted as “people” now? And not just accepted, but elevated to the celebrity status of sadly deceased genius cousin? It wasn’t all that long ago that scientists had been reluctant to accept the full humanity even of Aboriginal Australians. Gail Beck’s family had been denied their culture; treated in their own nation as unworthy of survival; their children ripped from their parents to be abused by strangers. In the nineteenth century Aboriginal Australians had been lumped together with Neanderthals as evolutionary dead ends, both destined for extinction.

On this point alone Darwin might have settled the race debate. He demonstrated that we could only have evolved from shared origins, that human races didn’t emerge separately. And on a personal level, this was important to him. Darwin’s family included two influential abolitionists, his grandfathers, Erasmus Darwin and Josiah Wedgwood. He himself had seen the brutality of slavery firsthand on his travels. When the naturalist Louis Agassiz, in the United States, spoke about human races as having separate origins, Darwin wrote disparagingly in a letter that this must have come as comfort to slaveholding Southerners.

He left open the possibility that, even though we could all be traced back to a common ancestor, populations may have diverged since then, producing levels of difference. As the British anthropologist Tim Ingold notes, Darwin saw gradations between the “highest men of the highest races and the lowest savages.” He suggested, for example, that the “children of savages” have a stronger tendency to protrude their lips when they sulk than European children, because, similar to chimps, they are closer to the “primordial condition.” The historian Gregory Radick at the University of Leeds notes that Darwin, even though he made such a bold and original contribution to the idea of racial unity, also seemed to be unembarrassed by his belief in an evolutionary hierarchy.

The uncertainty around the biological facts left more than enough room for ideology to be mixed with real science, leading to the fabrication of fresh racial myths. Brown and yellow races were a bit higher up, some argued, not unlike Darwin did. Whites were the most evolved—and by implication, the most civilized and the most human. What was seen as the success of the white races became couched in the language of the “survival of the fittest,” which carried the implication that the most “primitive” peoples, as they were described, would inevitably lose the struggle for survival as the human race evolved. Ingold argues that even Darwin himself began to frame evolution as an “imperialist doctrine of progress,” rather than seeing it as acting to make a species better adapted to its particular environment. “In bringing the rise of science and civilisation within the compass of the same evolutionary process that had made humans out of apes, and apes out of creatures lower in the scale, Darwin was forced to attribute what he saw as the ascendancy of reason to hereditary endowment,” writes Ingold. “For the theory to work, there had to be significant differences in such endowment between ‘tribes’ [and] ‘nations.”’ For hunter-gatherers to live so differently from city dwellers, the logic goes, it must be that their brains had not yet progressed to the same stage of evolution."""

In an 1865 essay on the emancipation of black slaves, he wrote that the average white was “bigger brained,” asserting, “The highest places in the hierarchy of civilization will assuredly not be within the reach of our dusky cousins.” For Huxley, freeing slaves was a morally good thing for white men to do, but the raw facts of biology made the idea of equal rights—for women as well as for black people—little more than an “illogical delusion.” In Germany, too, Darwin’s loudest cheerleader was Ernst Haeckel, who taught zoology at the University of Jena beginning in 1862 and was a proud nationalist.

Some saw it as a way of artificially speeding up human evolution, driving the race closer to mental and physical perfection.

He noted that of 605 notable men who lived between 1453 and 1853, one in six were related to another member of the same group. The ingredients for greatness must be heritable, he reasoned, choosing to overlook that their being notable might be a product of wealth and connections. “If a twentieth part of the cost and pains were spent in measures for the improvement of the human race that is spent on the improvement of the breed of horses and cattle, what a galaxy of genius might we not create!” Galton dreamed of a “utopia” of highly bred superpeople, and he made creating such a perfect society his lifelong mission."""

As Jobling explains, the divisions between us are so blurry that humans can theoretically be grouped any way you like. “You could do a thought experiment where you just said we will take Kenyans, Swedes, and Japanese, and will just proportion everybody into those three things.” If this were done, because we are all genetically connected to the average Kenyan, Swede, or Japanese person, either directly or by historic migration, then everyone on earth could theoretically be fully assigned to a group based on just these three nationalities. You could say that you were so many percent Kenyan, so many percent Swedish, and so many percent Japanese.” This may seem meaningless, but actually it is no more meaningless than dividing the world into black, brown, yellow, red, and white. “The definitions of those populations are cultural, and the choice of population is driven by expediency.” Other geneticists have also warned against dividing up the world. It imposes a certain order onto our species and ignores the actual fuzziness. If the Human Genome Diversity Project had proposed sampling people more systematically, in a grid pattern across the globe perhaps, the true overlapping nature of human variation would be easier to see. Scientists would have been able to map gradual, continuous variation across regions, rather than tight knots centered on very small communities. It’s hard not to imagine that this approach—which was mooted at the time but then discarded—might also have been a more effective way of fighting racism.

To some it may not seem racist to think about statistically average “populations” rather than distinct “types” of people. Certainly early population geneticists such as Dobzhansky believed that racism was rooted in the assumption that within one ethnic group people are all the same, whereas those like him believed that, within these groups, people are actually very different. But in the racist mind, as Gannett explains, it doesn’t necessarily matter how differences are distributed, so long as they are there in some form or another. This conceptual loophole in population genetics—the fact that we’re all different as individuals but that there is also some apparent order to this diversity—is what has since been seized upon by people with racist agendas.

But then, isn’t this exactly what racism is? A dislike of other groups in the belief that they are biologically different? In the mind of the racist, it probably doesn’t matter how big the groups happen to be, or if the differences are gradual or sharp. It presumably means equally little if it’s all about gene frequencies or population averages, so long as the differences are real. If the people of Pisa and Florence could have their mutual distrust validated by population genetics, then why not the people of any other two places? For Radin, the problem is obvious. It lies in the need to group in the first place, to separate even when that separation means having to zoom in on the very tiniest bits of the genome that might differ, and even then only on average. This need to separate, to treat people as different, is how race was invented. “What happens is that you’ve got a large community of very well meaning, self-described antiracist scientists seeking to find a way to move beyond race into population genetics, which seems to be incredibly neutral. It’s numbers, it’s statistical, it’s objective,” she says. “What they have a more difficult time reckoning with is that even something like population genetics is a science done by people, working with the assumptions and the ideas that are available at the time.” They may believe themselves to be free of racism, but they can’t help thinking about humans in racial terms."""

The Bajau tend to have disproportionately larger spleens than nearby populations of farmers, which possibly helps them to keep up their blood oxygen levels when diving. There appears to be a measurable genetic difference between them and others, sharpened over many generations by living in an unusual environment. This raises a question we don’t like to ask out loud, but one that goes to the heart of the race debate. It is where race science began, with a belief that neglects history and jumps straight to the conclusion that the human zoo is like an animal zoo, each of us defined deep down by our stripes and spots. And it leads straight from the offensive observation made by James Watson on the preponderance of Jewish intellectuals and Indian Brahmins in academia.

He and his colleagues stated that as recently as 5,800 years ago (just a heartbeat in evolutionary time), one genetic variant that was linked to the brain among other things had emerged and swept through populations because of evolution by natural selection. Their implication was that it bestowed some kind of survival advantage on our species, making our brains bigger and smarter. At the same time, he noted that this particular variant happened to be more common among people living in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of East Asia but was curiously rare in Africa and South America.

Even if his gene variants did show up with different frequencies in certain populations, it didn’t necessarily mean that they provided those who had them with a cognitive advantage.

So, soon after the papers were published, the controversial Canadian psychologist John Philippe Rushton ran IQ tests on hundreds of people to see if possessing the gene variants really did make a difference. Try as he might (and we can reasonably assume that as the head of the Pioneer Fund at the time, he tried his hardest), he couldn’t find any evidence they did. They neither increased head circumference nor general mental ability. Before long, critics piled on across the board, undermining every one of Lahn’s scientific and historical assertions. For a start, the gene variant he described as emerging 5,800 years ago could actually have appeared within a time range as wide as 500 to 14,100 years ago, so it may not have coincided with any major historical events. The respected University of Pennsylvania geneticist Sarah Tishkoff, who had been a coauthor on his papers, distanced herself from the suggestion that the gene variants in question might be linked to advances in human culture, as Lahn had suggested. There were doubts, too, that Lahn’s gene variants had seen any recent selection pressure at all. Tishkoff tells me that scientists today universally recognize intelligence as a highly complex trait, not only influenced by many genes but also likely to have evolved during the far longer portion of human history when we were all hunter-gatherers, until around ten thousand years ago. “There have been common selection pressures for intelligence,” she explains. “People don’t survive if they’re not smart and able to communicate. There’s no reason to think that there would be differential selection in different populations. That doesn’t mean somebody won’t find something someday.

In the United Kingdom, it has been estimated that those of South Asian ancestry can be up to six times as likely as other ethnic groups to receive a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. But even if some people may be genetically slightly more predisposed to a disease, this isn’t the same as actually receiving a diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes is well known to be heavily associated with lifestyle, such as diet and exercise, as well as age. Waist size is one of the most reliable correlations of all, which is why diabetes is becoming common among the middle classes of South Asia. Diets have always been rich in sugar and fat, but now people there are wealthier and more sedentary, leading to obesity. If diabetes were purely genetic, the world wouldn’t be seeing a diabetes epidemic at this moment and not before. “Just to say that it runs in your family is ludicrous,” says Yuille. “And it is fatalistic because it inhibits you from participating in activities that reduce risk.” This is what it means to be human, says Gregory Radick, “to know what it is to be a person and a body, to understand yourself along with everything else around you as this product of interactions between what you’ve inherited and your surroundings.” Then you can begin to see that you “haven’t been dealt a hand that you just have to accept, but it’s within our gift to change these things and to make improvements. When you change the context, you can potentially change the effects.” Another example of a condition that scientists believed is heritable is schizophrenia, a mental disorder for which people of black Caribbean ancestry living in the United Kingdom receive disproportionately more diagnoses than white people, to the point where it has even been described as a “black disease.” In recent years there have been feverish hunts for the genes thought to be responsible. In 2014 an enormous study involving more than 37,000 cases finally did find a number of genetic regions that may be associated with schizophrenia. But it turned out that the presence of even the most likely of these variants elevated the risk of suffering from schizophrenia by just a quarter of 1 percent over the risk in the population as a whole. One particular gene variant turned up in 27 percent of patients but also in around 22 percent of healthy subjects. If schizophrenia is inherited, then its inheritance clearly can’t be a straightforward equation. Indeed, environmental risk factors, including living in an urban environment and being an immigrant, have already been shown to be at least as important to being diagnosed as any genetic links found so far. One study published in Schizophrenia Bulletin in 2012 found that patients with psychosis were almost three times as likely to have been exposed to adversity as children. That’s not to say the disorder doesn’t have a genetic component, but it does demonstrate that it can’t be quantified by looking at genes in isolation. If there are racial differences in diagnoses, it may be that life experiences, perhaps even the negative experiences resulting from racial discrimination, tip some people over the edge while rescuing others. This is without even considering that schizophrenia diagnosis itself is known to be notoriously subjective. And if race is a factor, it’s interesting to contrast the characterization of schizophrenia as a “black disease” with an observation by the Nazi scientist Otmar von Verschuer who worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics in Germany. A year before the outbreak of World War II he wrote, “Schizophrenia is strikingly more frequent among Jews. According to statistics from Polish insane asylums, among insane Jews schizophrenia is twice as common as among insane Poles.” Then he made a leap, twisting a medical observation into a racial generalization: “Since it is a matter of a hereditary disease . . . the more frequent occurrence of the disease in Jews must be viewed as a racial characteristic.” At that moment in time in that particular place, then, it wasn’t a black disease; it was a Jewish one."""

They used to ask whether hypertension might even be a uniquely different illness in black people, connected somehow to skin pigmentation or testosterone levels, or to the heat and humidity of Africa. But as time passed and population studies were done, it turned out that people living in Africa, especially rural Africans, have the lowest levels of hypertension in the world. “The people are skinny, they don’t eat much salt, they’re very active. There is no way that blood pressures cannot be low. It’s just not possible. They don’t have diabetes and they don’t have hypertension,” says Cooper, who has carried out blood pressure studies on tens of thousands of people across Africa, Europe, and the Americas. People in Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa, from where most black Americans can trace their ancestry, are known to have far lower blood pressures than in other countries. In fact, Cooper adds, topping the hypertension charts are Finland, Germany, and Russia. “They have terrific hypertension.” White North Americans and Canadians, meanwhile, tend to have lower levels than Europeans, including those in England, Spain, and Italy. Hypertension, then, isn’t a global problem for those with black skin; it’s a local one. We know that black Americans certainly do have higher rates of hypertension on average than white Americans, and the same appears to be the case in Britain with black and white Britons."""

It was an evocative story, giving the tragic brutality of slavery an extra poignancy. Sensitivity to salt, which had helped some through the brutal journey across the Atlantic, landed their unfortunate descendants in the twentieth century with the fatal scourge of hypertension.

Richard Cooper adds that salt sensitivity, if it is seen to be higher in black Americans, is likely to be a product of being primed over a lifetime for all the factors that give them hypertension in the first place, particularly poor diet.

Kaufman and Cooper looked through all the published papers that studied responses to blood pressure medication. Their aim was to figure out just how many individuals actually benefit from this racial distinction. They discovered that the perceived racial differences in drug response are in fact relatively small compared with differences within racial groups—exactly to be expected, given everything scientists know about the genetics of human variation. So although there might be statistically significant differences at a population level, this isn’t always useful when it comes to designing a treatment for any one individual patient. For example, they found that for ACE-inhibitors, which are given to white patients under the age of fifty-five in the United Kingdom but not to black patients, data suggest that for a hundred white people given the drug, forty-eight of them would fail to respond as hoped.

Since 1993 the National Institutes of Health, the largest funder of medical research in the world, has had a general policy of requiring the clinical trials it supports to include women and minorities and also to collect data by race, across at least six categories. The purpose of this was never to look for differences between groups, but to ensure that medical studies include a broader spread of the population. As a demographic exercise, then, it made no difference that all black people, whether born in Africa or the United States, are today lumped by the National Institutes of Health into one general category, despite the prevalence of hypertension in their birth countries being completely different.

Thus, planning, and above all trust, openness and cooperation along the supply chain—rather than competition—are fundamental to continuous replacement. This is not the “kumbaya” analysis of two socialist writers; even the most hard-hearted commerce researchers and company directors argue that a prerequisite of successful supply chain management is that all participants in the chain recognize that they all will gain more by cooperating as a trusting, information-sharing whole than they will as competitors. The seller, for example, is in effect telling the buyer how much he will buy. The retailer has to trust the supplier with restocking decisions. Manufacturers are responsible for managing inventories in Walmart’s warehouses. Walmart and its suppliers have to agree when promotions will happen and by how much, so that increased sales are recognized as an effect of a sale or marketing effort, and not necessarily as a big boost in demand. And all supply chain participants have to implement data-sharing technologies that allow for realtime flow of sales data, distribution center withdrawals and other logistical information so that everyone in the chain can rapidly make adjustments."""

In the 1980s, the company began dealing directly with manufacturers to reduce the number of links within, and to more efficiently oversee, the supply chain. In 1995, Walmart further ramped up its cooperative supply chain approach under the moniker Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), in which all nodes in the chain collaboratively synchronize their forecasts and activities. As technology has advanced, the company has used CPFR to further enhance supply chain cooperation, from being the first to implement company-wide use of universal product bar codes to its more troubled relationship with radio-frequency ID tagging. Its gargantuan, satellite-connected Retail Link database connects demand forecasts with suppliers and distributes real-time sales data from cash registers all along the supply chain. Analysts describe how stockage and manufacture is “pulled,” almost moment-to-moment, by the consumer, rather than “pushed” by the company onto shelves.

A polymath, winner of both the Swedish National Bank’s Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (widely but inaccurately described as the Nobel Prize in Economics) and the Turing Award (widely and comparatively more accurately described as the Nobel Prize for Computing), Simon in 1991 offered up the following thought experiment—one that might have seemed out of place to regular readers of the prestigious but orthodox Journal of Economic Perspectives: Suppose that [a mythical visitor from Mars] approaches the Earth from space, equipped with a telescope that reveals social structures. The firms reveal themselves, say, as solid green areas with faint interior contours marking out divisions and departments. Market transactions show as red lines connecting firms, forming a network in the spaces between them. Within firms (and perhaps even between them) the approaching visitor also sees pale blue lines, the lines of authority connecting bosses with various levels of workers. As our visitor looked more carefully at the scene beneath, it might see one of the green masses divide, as a firm divested itself of one of its divisions. Or it might see one green object gobble up another. At this distance, the departing golden parachutes would probably not be visible. No matter whether our visitor approached the United States or the Soviet Union, urban China or the European Community, the greater pan of the space below it would be within the green areas, for almost all of the inhabitants would be employees, hence inside the firm boundaries. Organizations would be the dominant feature of the landscape. A message sent back home, describing the scene, would speak of “large green areas interconnected by red lines.” It would not likely speak of “a network of red lines connecting green spots.” Simon intended his tale of visiting Martians as a light chiding of his fellow economists for ignoring how pervasive authoritarian power relationships and planning actually are under capitalism. Planning was in fact almost everywhere you looked, even though the discipline of economics had largely spun tales even more fantastical than UFOs visiting Earth: the fairy story of a harmonious and self-regulating market economy."""

For this, Lange repurposed another idea from Walras: tatonnement. In French, Walras’s native tongue, the word means “groping toward.” Walras imagined that markets groped toward the right prices until they found the holy grail of economics: general equilibrium, where all markets are in balance and the amount supplied of every single good or service is exactly equal to the amount demanded. Add some more math, and mainstream economists will tell you that they’ve proven that everyone is also as happy as can be, living in the best of all possible worlds."""

Unlike in Otto Neurath’s natural economy (discussed in chapter 2), people under Lange’s market socialism would still go to (government-run) stores to buy consumer goods, signaling to planners what they wanted produced. Producers—all also publicly owned—would aim to produce what the planners translated from consumer demands as efficiently as possible, without needing to leave room for profit after covering costs. As the economy produced things and consumers bought them, central planners would run equations, figure out what there was too much of and what there was too little of, and adjust the “shadow prices” until everything was in sync. Even without all the correct information available at once, Lange’s expected his planners to grope toward equilibrium like markets did under capitalism, only better and faster."""

Phillips and Rozworski 2019: three major failures of neoclassical theory: markets are costly (Coase), humans are imperfect (Stiglitz), equilibrium rarely occur and dynamism is key (Hayek): <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1110266691> <https://u1lib.org/book/3705952/801cf6> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858787271905116210/phillips2019.pdf> """Over time, as outlined in this chapter, many poked holes in these assumptions: Markets are costly, said Coase. Human beings are not infinitely powered, all-knowing calculators, argued Stiglitz. Even Hayek was right: capitalism is dynamic, not static, and rarely in the sort of equilibrium imagined by Lange and conventional economics."""

# on the misuse of the "invisible hand" and collusion
Phillips and Rozworski 2019: the invisible hand features just once in Adam Smith, who also extensively discusses market power (such as collusion): <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1110266691> <https://u1lib.org/book/3705952/801cf6> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858787271905116210/phillips2019.pdf> """Adam Smith, the eighteenth-century Scot now considered the father of economics, is famous for introducing the “invisible hand” of the market. By this he meant no mystical force, but the idea that while individuals are making decisions whether to sell or to buy in the pursuit of self-interest, they are “led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of [their] intention”—the welfare of society realized through a market system. Smith’s hand often appears in economics textbooks as proof that markets produce, without any kind of plan, the best possible outcomes. However, Smith himself understood that real economies involve all manner of nonmarket interactions—even the phrase “invisible hand” makes but a single appearance in his Wealth of Nations. Smith, for example, assumed that factory owners would scheme together—that is, plan —to keep wages low. Later economists would concentrate only on the first half of his story: that the market system produces order out of chaos, all on its own."""

# on misuse of "tragedy of the commons" and Elinor Ostrom
Phillips and Rozworski 2019: tragedy of the commons is a real phenomenon, but it did not occur in England -- where the commons was used fairly effectively as pasture land for hundreds of years, and was forcibly enclosed by aristocrats and capitalists: <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1110266691> <https://u1lib.org/book/3705952/801cf6> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858787271905116210/phillips2019.pdf> """In response to any mention of durable human cooperation that is not mediated by markets, in particular by the undisguised incentives provided by the labor market—at their most basic, work or starve—defenders of the market system often bring up the notion of the “tragedy of the commons.” The phrase, coined by ecologist Garrett Hardin in a 1968 article in the journal Science, refers to a shared resource inevitably depleted through overuse by individuals acting in their self-interest. The prototypical commons employed to illustrate this tragedy is a plot of open, shared pastureland in a village. If farmers only look out for the cows that are theirs, rather than the entire pasture, each will allow their cows to overgraze, and the land shared in common will quickly turn to dust. Over the course of her long career, Elinor Ostrom, the only woman to win the “not really a Nobel” prize in economics in its fifty-year existence, did much to debunk this crude story. She compiled evidence of groups stewarding common resources and found that in many cases, the commons not only survived but thrived. Rather than being overrun by unthinking selfinterest, shared resources were in reality often governed by complex sets of social rules established over time. Ostrom studied actual shared pasture land in Swiss alpine villages and found it had been preserved for common use for over 500 years. Based on this and other case studies, Ostrom went on to identify conditions that helped protect common resources—among them, participation in decision making by users of the resources, the capacity for monitoring usage, meaningful social sanctions and conflict-resolution mechanisms."""

Hayek argued that markets—incomplete, permanently off tilt, full of fallible humans—do not just aggregate and calculate information. Markets are producers of information and knowledge. Even if Lange’s market socialism allowed planners to calculate better and faster than did free markets, planning would ultimately still be impossible because planners would not have the information created by market interactions to use in their calculations. Buying and selling may not generate technical and scientific knowledge, but it still creates all that knowledge of “time and place” that is instrumental to making efficient production and distribution decisions. Hayek argued that the problem for planners was not in the “how”—the equations to use—but in the “what”—the data that goes into the equations. The copious information planners need is unavailable before markets work their magic. Decentralization creates coordination: only the market can bring together the information that is normally isolated in the heads of different individuals."""

In the end, every serious restriction of capital markets threatens the reproduction of the capitalist spirit … The unleashing of finance not only channels savings to investment in a particular way, but it also sets up a particular form of organization in capitalist society. In short, Hayek may be right that prices aid in discovery under capitalism; however, that insight cannot be generalized to every socioeconomic system, including that which might supersede capitalism."""

Once enough examples of failing markets accumulate, the entire system’s efficiency and justice can be called into doubt. In short, the economics of information ultimately challenges the argument that capitalism, despite its flaws, is the best of all possible worlds. However, rather than seeing information problems as a reason to explore collective, democratic decision-making alternatives that could bring people and information together, economists went to work making market theory work in spite of humanity’s imperfections. Since the ’70s, the economics of information has generated ever more ingenious ideas for incentivizing people or organizations to do things—all, of course, within the bounds of capitalist markets."""

Phillips and Rozworski 2019: mechanism design is one solution to deeply imperfect markets; another is to socialize those markets, which avoids the corporate power concerns of concentrated market power: <http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1110266691> <https://u1lib.org/book/3705952/801cf6> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/858787271905116210/phillips2019.pdf> """Mechanism design is one such idea. In this obscure corner of economics, economists drum up—elegant, but often mathematically complex—means to compel people or companies to reveal information that they would otherwise keep secret. A new auction format created by economists in the early 1990s to help the US government sell off cell phone frequencies to telecommunications firms is an exemplary case. The auction had rules designed to force companies to reveal how much the rights to frequencies were really worth to them—lying would see them lose the rights to competitors. The design netted the government hundreds of millions of dollars more than expected and is now commonplace around the world. Mechanism design is a kind of planning, although a very indirect one. Economic decision making of any kind—whether outright planning or a “designed” market—needs to gather the bits and pieces of information spread between people. But information problems don’t preclude other ways of doing things. Rather than creating a complex process that ultimately benefits a few big players, governments today could choose to run a public cell phone utility, which would constitute one more step on the way to greater socialization. As things stand, however, governments make some money on the auction, but give up control over a valuable resource. This also leaves behind a market dominated by a few big players who can charge famously high prices backed by shoddy customer service."""

Zooming out beyond Amazon’s corporate interests, the recommendations system is a way of managing and integrating great swaths of social labor. Many of us freely, without expectation of any reward, spend time and energy writing reviews and giving out stars to products or even just mindlessly browsing on Amazon and other technology platforms. This is work that we and others benefit from. Even over the course of one day, we may repeatedly engage in unpaid labor to rate everything from the relatively innocuous, such as call quality on Skype, to the more serious, such as posts, comments and links on Facebook and Twitter, to the potentially very impactful on individual lives, such as the “quality” of Uber drivers.

All of these reforms serve to make planning explicit and public, rather than hidden and private as it is today. To quote J. W. Mason once more, A society that truly subjected itself to the logic of market exchange would tear itself to pieces, but the conscious planning that confines market outcomes within tolerable bounds has to be hidden from view because if the role of planning was acknowledged, it would undermine the idea of markets as natural and spontaneous and demonstrate the possibility of conscious planning toward other ends."""

[....] Both fears were warranted. As they expanded, worker-run schemes did indeed start to challenge the absolute power of doctors over medical care. Worker societies did not so much target individual clinical decisions— rather, they increasingly wanted a say in planning, in how resources were allocated. Would new money go into building clinics or hiring nurses—or into savings accounts held by doctors? The most forward-thinking societies advocated for doctors to become salaried workers rather than contractors— people thus invested in the expansion of medical practice, rather than that of personal fortunes. As with any other sector, medicine has its own logistic specificities. Decisions have to be made about where clinics are located, how to divide tasks between nurses and doctors, which afflictions should be prioritized, and so on.

Even by 1994, three years into the internal market, the NHS had hired 10,000 new managers. While administration costs made up just 5 percent of the total NHS budget in the 1980s, by 2005 they had nearly tripled, to 14 percent of the total. On these simple measures, planning was several times as efficient as the market. A 2014 report from the UK’s Center for Health and the Public Interest put the cost of just running the internal market itself at an estimated £4.5 billion per year—enough to pay for dozens of new hospitals. [....] Have all of these additional costs created new benefits? At best, it’s hard to tell. Every patient comes into treatment with their own personal history, including all the social determinants of health, making comparison very difficult. On an aggregate level, recall that as England moved further along the market path, Scotland decided in the late 1990s to return to a more public NHS, where patients are not just consumers of healthcare but owners of the healthcare service itself. Since then, the Scottish NHS has improved more rapidly on important indicators, such as wait time for a hospital bed or an ambulance. On other measures like life expectancy, the gap between relatively poorer Scotland and its southern cousin remains steady, as well."""

Marx’s critique of capitalism, which acknowledges its accomplishments while laying bare its exploitative underpinnings and irrational dynamic, remains just that: critique. Marx offers no model for an alternative economic order, no “recipes for cookshops of the future,” in his disdainful phrase. [....] [H]istorical materialism claims that capitalism, the dominant economic system of Marx’s day and our own, will be superseded by a more rational order. This successor system has been traditionally called “socialism,” and has been viewed as itself a stage on the way to a higher “communism.” But as anyone who has studied Marx knows, there is a blank page at precisely this point in his theory. Marx says almost nothing as to what this “socialism” would look like. Virtually no attention is given to the institutional structures that are to replace those of capitalism and thus define an economic order genuinely superior to capitalism.
Schweickart 2011: like progressive christians, we should be inspired by past socialist movements but not seek to defend their every action: <https://www.google.com/books/edition/After_Capitalism/X0sBA_ya34gC> <http://library.lol/main/E2354BFCF7B8EDBE42BAE74F02BC20FA> <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/827934025355624498/schweickart2011.pdf> The counterproject must keep the tradition alive without denying the shortcomings and failures—sometimes horrific—of individuals, parties, and governments that have called themselves socialist or communist. This is not so strange. Consider the parallel with Christianity. Progressive Christians draw strength and inspiration from the Christian tradition without denying the inquisitions, religious wars, corruption, and abuse that are also a part of Christianity’s history. There are values, and lives committed to those values, in both traditions (essentially the same values—as liberation theologians have demonstrated) that continue to inspire.

The counter-project will not be what Marx decried as “crude communism,” a communism animated by envy, which wants to level down and destroy whatever cannot be enjoyed by all. 13 It will be a project that builds on the material and cultural accomplishments of past centuries. It will embrace the political ideals of liberty, democracy, and the rule of law. It will endorse and promote such values as generosity, solidarity, and human creativity, and also self-discipline, personal responsibility, and hard work. It will not sneer at any of these ideals or values as “bourgeois.” They will be regarded as indispensable to the construction of a new and better world.

The great significance of the proletariat's struggle for equality and of equality as a slogan will be clear if we correctly interpret it as meaning the abolition of classes. But democracy means only formal equality. And as soon as equality is achieved for all members of society in relation to ownership of the means of production, that is, equality of labor and wages, humanity will inevitably be confronted with the question of advancing further from formal equality to actual equality, i.e., to the operation of the rule "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". By what stages, by means of what practical measures humanity will proceed to this supreme aim we do not and cannot know. But it is important to realize how infinitely mendacious is the ordinary bourgeois conception of socialism as something lifeless, rigid, fixed once and for all, whereas in reality only socialism will be the beginning of a rapid, genuine, truly mass forward movement, embracing first the majority and then the whole of the population, in all spheres of public and private life. Democracy is of enormous importance to the working class in its struggle against the capitalists for its emancipation. But democracy is by no means a boundary not to be overstepped; it is only one of the stages on the road from feudalism to capitalism, and from capitalism to communism. Democracy is a form of the state, it represents, on the one hand, the organized, systematic use of force against persons; but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of equality of citizens, the equal right of all to determine the structure of, and to administer, the state. This, in turn, results in the fact that, at a certain stage in the development of democracy, it first welds together the class that wages a revolutionary struggle against capitalism--the proletariat, and enables it to crush, smash to atoms, wipe off the face of the earth the bourgeois, even the republican-bourgeois, state machine, the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy and to substitute for them a more democratic state machine, but a state machine nevertheless, in the shape of armed workers who proceed to form a militia involving the entire population. Here "quantity turns into quality": such a degree of democracy implies overstepping the boundaries of bourgeois society and beginning its socialist reorganization. If really all take part in the administration of the state, capitalism cannot retain its hold."""
Lenin 1917: on the transition from capitalism to socialism: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/lenin/state-and-revolution.pdf> """The development of capitalism, in turn, creates the preconditions that enable really “all” to take part in the administration of the state. Some of these preconditions are: universal literacy, which has already been achieved in a number of the most advanced capitalist countries, then the "training and disciplining" of millions of workers by the huge, complex, socialized apparatus of the postal service, railways, big factories, large-scale commerce, banking, etc., etc. Given these economic preconditions, it is quite possible, after the overthrow of the capitalists and the bureaucrats, to proceed immediately, overnight, to replace them in the control over production and distribution, in the work of keeping account of labor and products, by the armed workers, by the whole of the armed population. (The question of control and accounting should not be confused with the question of the scientifically trained staff of engineers, agronomists, and so on. These gentlemen are working today in obedience to the wishes of the capitalists and will work even better tomorrow in obedience to the wishes of the armed workers.) Accounting and control--that is mainly what is needed for the "smooth working", for the proper functioning, of the first phase of communist society. All citizens are transformed into hired employees of the state, which consists of the armed workers. All citizens becomes employees and workers of a single countrywide state “syndicate”. All that is required is that they should work equally, do their proper share of work, and get equal pay; the accounting and control necessary for this have been simplified by capitalism to the utmost and reduced to the extraordinarily simple operations--which any literate person can perform--of supervising and recording, knowledge of the four rules of arithmetic, and issuing appropriate receipts."""
Lenin 1917: on the transition from socialism to communism: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm> <https://www.marxists.org/ebooks/lenin/state-and-revolution.pdf> """When the majority of the people begin independently and everywhere to keep such accounts and exercise such control over the capitalists (now converted into employees) and over the intellectual gentry who preserve their capitalist habits, this control will really become universal, general, and popular; and there will be no getting away from it, there will be "nowhere to go". The whole of society will have become a single office and a single factory, with equality of labor and pay. But this “factory” discipline, which the proletariat, after defeating the capitalists, after overthrowing the exploiters, will extend to the whole of society, is by no means our ideal, or our ultimate goal. It is only a necessary step for thoroughly cleansing society of all the infamies and abominations of capitalist exploitation, and for further progress. From the moment all members of society, or at least the vast majority, have learned to administer the state themselves, have taken this work into their own hands, have organized control over the insignificant capitalist minority, over the gentry who wish to preserve their capitalist habits and over the workers who have been thoroughly corrupted by capitalism--from this moment the need for government of any kind begins to disappear altogether. The more complete the democracy, the nearer the moment when it becomes unnecessary. The more democratic the “state” which consists of the armed workers, and which is "no longer a state in the proper sense of the word", the more rapidly every form of state begins to wither away. For when all have learned to administer and actually to independently administer social production, independently keep accounts and exercise control over the parasites, the sons of the wealthy, the swindlers and other "guardians of capitalist traditions", the escape from this popular accounting and control will inevitably become so incredibly difficult, such a rare exception, and will probably be accompanied by such swift and severe punishment (for the armed workers are practical men and not sentimental intellectuals, and they scarcely allow anyone to trifle with them), that the necessity of observing the simple, fundamental rules of the community will very soon become a habit. Then the door will be thrown wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state."""

# summary of blanc's position
Blanc 2022: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UjVAoWwGs> """I wanna first summarize some of the lessons that we on the panel tonight agree on: First, and maybe most importantly, the Russian Revolution showed that cpaitalism isn't eternal, it showed that working people can overthrow the current system and start building a society that establishes democracy in the economy and not just in politics. Second, it shows that the strategy to get to that goal, not a strategic alliance with liberals or capitalists. Third, to overthrow capitalism, workers need their own party, and Marxists have a central role to play in making that party effective. Finally, the class struggle is international, and the struggle of workers in every country is deeply interlinked."""

# importance of democracy
Blanc 2022: workers conquered democracy and it's good politics to defend that victory: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UjVAoWwGs> """Lenin's claim that "the democratic republic is the best possible shell for capitalism", which is often quoted by Leninists, severely underestimates the extent to which democratic parliaments were won by and for working people. What democracy we have is a conquest to be defended and expanded. This conception of Lenin that the democratic republic undercuts our ability to make the case to working people that it's always the right, not the left, that wants to undermine universal suffrage and democratically elected parliaments, which we've seen most recently through the rise of Trumpism and the January 6 insurrection."""

# first major flaw of leninism: the russian revolution cannot be overgeneralized
Blanc 2022: fundamental flaw of Leninism: assume that revolutionary strategies in autocratic Russia can be generalized to capitalist democracies: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UjVAoWwGs> """Those in the Leninist tradition, including organizations like Socialist Alternative, tend to overgeneralize strategy from the Russian Revolution to the contexts of capitalist democracies. The fundamental flaw of Leninism, in my view, and this comes from the research I did and organizing experience as well, is to assume that a form of revolution and a form of party that was appropriate to autocratic Russia can more or less be transplanted to capitalist countries where civil liberties and democratic institutions are significantly more robust, even if they don't go as far as we'd like. More specifcially, I think it's wrong to claim that the Revolution illustrates the universal validity of one, a new conception of revolution as laid out in Lenin's "State and Revolution", according to which the entire existing state overthrown everywhere through a mass uprising to set up council republics, and two, it supposedly showed the necessity for a new form of revolutionary party, one committed to democratic centralism, and a revolutionary Leninist program. By new, here, I mean that this is a different form of party and revolution than the position long articulated by the left of the 2nd International, most notably by Karl Kautsky. The founding myth of Leninism, I think I've shown in the book, is that supposedly the secret to the success of the Bolsheviks in 1917 was that they broke from Kautsky's strategy, known at the time as "revolutionary social democracy", and that supposedly all other socialists should follow them in doing the same. But as I've shown in the book, this is just historically wrong, and it's politically flawed. Unlike in Germany, where Kautsky's revolutionary theories were ignored by the party leadership, in autocratic Russia, this theory was implemented -- not only by the Bolsheviks, but by all the other nationalities that led working people to conquer power in 1917 and 1918, including in Finland. This revolutionary-social-democratic strategy was premised on the correct understanding that class struggle and revolutions would develop qualitatively different in democratic and autocratic contexts. It was precisely this understanding, this distinction between politics in autocratic and democratic capitalist countries, that Leninists tended to drop from 1918 onward, or at least minimize excessively."""
Blanc 2022: workers in capitalist democracies choose to use democracy to meet their demands, which is why these workers have not supported revolution: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UjVAoWwGs> """According to Leninists, the Russian Revolution shows that socialists should seek to overthrow the entire existing state, even when a democratically elected parliament exists. The problem with this claim is that it doesn't actually follow in the Russian Revolution! [Leninists] say taht the Russian Revolution proves this, but there was no democratically elected parliament to be overthrown in Russia to be overthrown. Precisely because of that, soviets (or councils) were able to fill the vacuum. It's hard to generalize from the Russian experience (at least, not Finland) to countries where such a democratic parliament does exist. All the experience during and since 1917 shows that, where a democratic parliament *does* exist, workers will try to use it to meet their demands, including for socialist transformation. That's the basic reason why Leninist revolution has never come close to taking place in a capitalist democracy. We should acknowledge that and adjust accordingly. One of the underlying flaws in Leninism, then, is its assumption that workers in all countries of the world will sooner or later behave as radically as workers did in Russia in 1917. And honestly, I really wish that it turned out to be true! That would be fantastic, if it turned out to be true, it hasn't turned out to be true. We should acknowledge that and orient to the working class as it is, not as we wish it to be. If we do that, it will help us avoid a tendency of Leninists and others to excessively blame bad leadership -- which is often a real problem! -- for holding back the revolutionary instincts of the masses. There's a lot more going on for what it's gonna take to overthrow capitalism in a different context."""
Blanc 2022: capitalism survives because capitalists are powerful, not because socialists have bad leadership or the wrong socialist line: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UjVAoWwGs> """The main reason that capitalism hasn't been overthrown yet isn't that socialists have strayed from the correct socialist line. The main reason is that capitalists are very powerful, and that most workers in capitalist democracies have oriented to trying to make the state work for them, rather than trying to overthrow it. Of course, should socialists win a majority through parliamentary means, and begin to push for socialist transformation, capitalists will resist this with all means available for their disposal. There's reason to expect that the capitalist minority will peacefully submit to the minority. But it does not follow from this that universal suffrage are necessarily a form of capitalist rule, as Leninists claim. It just means that you need to leverage legitimacy structures of winning a democratic election in order to defeat the anti-democratic capitalist minority, and the undemocratic structures of the state, like the police and the army. This is precisely what happened in Finland, which had a sustained political freedom tradition and universal suffrage. There, socialists won a majority in 1916, they proceeded to try to implement their program in 1917, then when the capitalists undemocratically resisted, Finnish socialists led workers to power in 1918 to fulfill their mandate. To be clear, my argument isn't that we should try to copy Kautsky today, or that Finland is some sort of new universal model to be replicated. I think it's more narrow: Finland does show that revolutionary social democratic strategy *could* guide workers to power and that the class struggle -- and this is a big point -- tends to develop very differently where there's political freedom and where real parliaments exist, as opposed to contexts where they don't."""

# second major flaw of leninism: organizational strategy
Blanc 2022: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UjVAoWwGs> """The second major flaw in Leninism is its claim that the Russian Revolution demonstrated the universal validity of a new party model, based on democratic centralism, strict organizational separation from socialists who didn't adhere to Lenin's new conception of state and revolution. To summarize a big history: The story [of the Russian revolution] severely exaggerates the organizational coherence and programmatic unity of the Bolshevik. In practice, this conception often tends to lead to sectarianism. Because Bolsheviks operated in an autocratic context, in which top leaders have to live abroad, and in which local committes would constantly get broken up by police, the actual practices of the Bolsheviks and other revolutionaries in Imperial Russia were extremely decentralized and fluid -- way more than any Leninist organization since 1917. The historical record just doesn't correspond *at all* to the image of a tight, united party that Leninists have tried to replicate. Moreover, the secret sauce of the Bolsheviks, and the other successful Marxists in the [Russian] Empire, like the Latvians or the Finns or others, was that they operated as relatively loose, fluid, and organic currents within a broader multi-[tendency] big tent party. Though exiled leaders tended to squabble a lot, Bolshevik on the ground, cadre on the ground, were always focused on building a leading that broader party as good faith partners with other currents. They weren't primarily just intervening in this party just to build their own organization. Because Leninists since 1918 through the present have tended to excesssively wall themselves off organizationally form other socialist currents, and because they insist that only their particular conception of state and revolution is viable, their organizations have frequently devolved into sects -- sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller. We should move away from that organizational conception, and our chances at building a majoritarian socialist movement depend on acknowledging that because there's never been a successful socialist revolution in a capitalist democracy, nobody can claim to have a precise strategic model of the way forward. We should be skeptical of claims that that model exists and just needs to be replicated."""

A. Cohen examines the libertarian principle of self-ownership, which says that each person belongs to himself and therefore owes no service or product to anyone else. This principle is used to defend capitalist inequality, which is said to reflect each person's freedom to do as he wishes with himself. The author argues that self-ownership cannot deliver the freedom it promises to secure. He thereby undermines the idea that lovers of freedom should embrace capitalism and the inequality that comes with it. He goes on to show that the standard Marxist condemnation of exploitation implies an endorsement of self-ownership, since, in the Marxist conception, the employer steals from the worker what should belong to her, because she produced it. Thereby a deeply inegalitarian notion has penetrated what is in aspiration an egalitarian theory. Purging that notion from socialist thought, he argues, enables construction of a more consistent egalitarianism."""

Revolutionary workers and, a fortiori, bourgeois fellow-travellers without a particular material interest in socialism, must perforce be morally inspired.

And as society has hitherto moved in class antagonisms, morality has always been class morality; it has either justified the domination and the interests of the ruling class, or ever since the oppressed class became powerful enough, it has represented its indignation against this domination and the future interests of the oppressed. That in this process there has on the whole been progress in morality, as in all other branches of human knowledge, no one will doubt. But we have not yet passed beyond class morality. A really human morality which stands above class antagonisms and above any recollection of them becomes possible only at a stage of society which has not only overcome class antagonisms but has even forgotten them in practical life.

A. Cohen, since he has joined Marx in embracing the "practical effects" test as the relevant measure of value in matters theoretical.17 And once we take that as the measure of theoretical value, then the turn to normative theory that Cohen recommends for Marxists has no real justification. Marxists, like Posnerians, think that what we really need is an empirical understanding of how the world works, not ineffectual exhortation by academic philosophers to do the morally right thing. Marxists and Posnerians differ, to be sure, over how the world really works. But that question is, to quote Cohen, "where the action is," or at least ought to be."""

There certainly still exist key producers, exploited people, and needy people, but these are not, now, as they were in the past, even roughly coincident designations, nor, still less, alternative designations of the great majority of the population. And, as a result, there is no group with both (because of its exploitation, and its neediness) a compelling interest in, and (because of its productiveness, and its numbers) a ready capacity to achieve, a socialist transformation.

Feudal law and usage require that the serf give up part of his life to the lord. The theft of the serfs labour time begins when he leaves his own plot and proceeds to fulfil his duties on the lord's demesne. It is manifestly true, a matter not of theory but of observation, that the serf spends part of his time working for himself and another part in unrecompensed4 work for the lord. According to Marx, it is no less true of the wage worker that he is forced to give up part of his life to a powerful superior. But the truth is, in his case, much less manifest. For two surface features of capitalism conceal its underlying reality. First, under capitalism exploitation is mediated by a contract which the worker is formally (albeit only formally) free not to enter: the serf, by contrast, enjoys no formal freedom not to work for the lord. And second, the division of the worker's labour time into time that he works for himself and time that he works for the capitalist requires economic analysis and is not, as it is in the feudal case, a matter of observation."""

But you can steal from someone only that which properly belongs to him.

But he could hardly have that right without having the right to decide what to do with his own capacity to work, his labour power. The claim that capitalists steal labour time from working people therefore implies that the worker is the proper owner of his own power. But Marxists could not think that the worker is the proper owner of his own power unless they thought that the same is true of people in general. Hence the Marxist contention that the capitalist exploits the worker depends on the proposition that people are the rightful owners of their own powers. That proposition is the thesis of self-ownership, and I claim that (something like)5 it undergirds the Marxist case for the proposition that the capitalist relationship is inherently exploitative.

In that critique, the exploitation of workers by capitalists derives entirely from the fact that workers have been deprived of access to physical productive resources and must therefore sell their labour power to capitalists, who enjoy a class monopoly in those resources. Hence, for Marxists, the injustice of capitalism is traceable to an initial inequality with respect to the distribution of external things, and suppression of exploitation should therefore require no rejection of the thesis of self-ownership: a rectification of original resource inequality should suffice. If its diagnosis of the source of capitalist injustice were correct, then Marxism could prescribe as an antidote to it what left libertarians prescribe as a matter of principle. But no Marxist would in fact tolerate a world in which differential talent allows self-owning individuals to be class-divided into buyers and sellers of labour-power, even when that position is reached from a starting point of initial equality of external resources.

# social revolution through reform in feudal europe

Kautsky 1902: social revolution as a single rupture largely did not occur in feudal Europe, but instead proceeded via many gradual, imperceptible steps: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1902/socrev/pt1-1.htm> """If the universal armament of the people did not encourage great social revolutions, it did make it much easier for armed conflict between the classes to arise at the slightest opportunity. There is no lack of violent uprisings and civil wars in antiquity and the Middle Ages. The ferocity with which these were fought was often so great as to lead to the expulsion, expropriation and oftentimes to the extermination of the conquered. Those who consider violence as a sign of social revolution will find plenty of such revolutions in earlier ages. But those who conceive social revolution as the conquest of political power by a previously subservient class and the transformation of the juridical and political superstructure of society, particularly in the property relations, will find no social revolution there. Social development proceeded piece-meal, step by step, not through single great catastrophes but in countless little broken-up, apparently disconnected, often interrupted, ever renewing, mostly unconscious movements. The great social transformation of the times we are considering, the disappearance of slavery in Europe, came about so imperceptibly that the contemporaries of this movement took no notice of it, and one is to-day compelled to reconstruct it through hypotheses."""
Kautsky 1902: social revolution in feudal Europe was difficult because most communities possessed no identity or material ties beyond their community, which limited the scope of a class revolution: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1902/socrev/pt1-1.htm> """Revolutions in Antiquity and the Middle Ages Any definite conclusion as to whether revolution is a necessity or not can be drawn only from an investigation of the facts of social development, and not through analogies with natural science. It is only necessary to glance at these earlier stages of development in order to see that social revolution, in the narrow sense in which we are here using it, is no necessary accompaniment of social development. There was a social development and a very far-reaching one before the rise of class antagonisms and political power. In these stages the conquest of political power by an oppressed class, and consequently a social revolution, was as a matter of course impossible. Even after class antagonisms and political power have arisen it is a long time before we find, either in antiquity or the Middle Ages, anything which corresponds to our idea of revolution. We find plenty of examples of bitter class struggles, civil wars and political catastrophes, but none of these brought about a fundamental and permanent renovation of the conditions of property and therewith a new social form. To my mind the reasons for this are as follows: In antiquity and also in the Middle ages the center of gravity of the economic and also of the political life lay in the community. Each community was sufficient in itself in all essential points and was only attached to the exterior world through loose bands. The great states were only conglomerates of communities which were held together only through either a dynasty or through another ruling and exploiting community. Each community had its own special economic development corresponding to its own peculiar characteristics and corresponding to these also its special class struggles. The political revolutions also at that time were chiefly only communal revolutions. It was as a matter of course impossible to transform the whole social life of a great territory by a political revolution."""

Kautsky 1902: there is half-truth in the idea that democracy changes the revolutionary struggle: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1902/socrev/pt1-3.htm> """But does not democracy provide the foundation for a gradual, imperceptible transformation of capitalism into Socialism without any violent break with existing things if we but presuppose the conquest of political power by the proletariat? There are some politicians who assert that only despotic class rule necessitates revolution; that revolution is rendered superfluous by democracy. It is claimed that we have today sufficient democracy in all civilized countries to make possible a peaceable revolutionless development. Above all it is possible to found cooperatives for consumption whose extension will introduce production for use, and so slowly but surely drive capitalist production out of one sphere after another. Most important of all, it is possible to organize unions that shall continually limit the power of the capitalist in his business, until constitutionalism shall supplant absolutism in the factory, and thus the way will be prepared for the slow transition to the republicanized factory. Still further, the socialists can penetrate into the municipal councils, influence public labor in the interest of the laboring class, extend the circle of municipal activities, and by the continuous extension of the circle of municipal production narrow the field of private production. Finally the socialists are pressing into parliament, where they are ever gaining more influence, and push through one reform after the other, restrict the power of the capitalists by labor legislation, and simultaneously extend ever wider the circle of governmental production, while they work for the nationalization of the great monopolies. So by the exercise of democratic rights upon existing grounds the capitalist society is gradually and without any shock growing into Socialism. Consequently the revolutionary conquest of political powers by the proletariat is unnecessary, and the efforts towards it directly hurtful, since they can operate in no other way than to disturb this slowly but surely advancing process. So much for the opponents of revolutionary development. It is an attractive picture they have painted for us, and again it cannot be truthfully said that it is wholly built in the air. The facts upon which it is founded actually exist. But the truth that they tell is only a half-truth. A little dialectical reflection would have shown them the whole."""

Nothing would be more incorrect. On the contrary, all these are of incalculable value to the proletariat. They are only insignificant as means to avoid a revolution. This conquest of political power by the proletariat is of the highest value exactly because it makes possible a higher form of the revolutionary struggle. This struggle is no longer, as in 1789, a battle of unorganized mobs with no political form, with no insight into the relative strength of the contending factors: with no profound comprehension of the purposes of the struggle and the means to its solution; no longer a battle of mobs that can be deceived and bewildered by every rumor or accident. It is a battle of organized, intelligent masses, full of stability and prudence, that do not follow every impulse or explode over every insult, or collapse under every misfortune. On the other hand, the elections are a means to count ourselves and the enemy and they grant thereby a clear view of the relative strength of the classes and parties, their advance and their retreat. They prevent premature outbreaks and they guard against defeats. They also grant the possibility that the opponents will themselves recognize the untenability of many positions and freely surrender them when their maintenance is no life-and-death question for them. So that the battle demands fewer victims, is less sanguinary and depends less upon blind chance."""

It is the first time in the history of the world that we are confronted with a revolutionary struggle to be fought out under the application of democratic forms by organizations created upon the foundation of democratic freedom against resources such as the world has not yet seen, prominent among which are organizations of employers before which even monarchs bow and whose power will be strengthened by the governmental powers of bureaucracy and militarism, which the modern great nations have inherited from absolutism."""

Under absolutism, against which former revolutions were turned, the government was supreme and class antagonisms could not clearly develop. The government hindered not alone the exploited but also the exploiting classes from freely defending their interests. On the side Of government there stood only a portion of the exploiting class; another and a very considerable part of the exploiters, namely, the industrial capitalists, mere in the camp of the opposition, together with the whole mass of the laboring class – not simply proletarians, but also the small bourgeois and the peasants – except in some backward localities. Government was also isolated from the people. It had no hold on the broad masses of the populace; it represented the most highly favored strength of the oppression and the exploitation of the people. A coup d’etat could under certain circumstances suffice to overthrow it. In a democracy not alone the exploited but the exploiting class can more freely develop their organization, and it is necessary that they do this if they are to be able to resist their opponents. The strength not only of the former but of the latter as well is greater than under absolutism. They use their forces recklessly and more harshly than the government itself, which no longer stands above them, but rather beneath them. The revolutionary circles have also to deal not only with the government but also with the powerful organizations of the exploiters. And the revolutionary circles no longer represent as in the early revolutions an overwhelming majority of the people opposed to a handful of exploiters. To-day they represent in reality only one class, the proletariat, to which not only the whole body of the exploiting class, but also the great mass of the farmers, and a great majority of the intellectuals stand opposed."""
