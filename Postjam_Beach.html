            A map of central Postjam Beach
            </div>
        </div>
    	<p>
			The city has 1 main road that leads through the center of town. The city itself has its districts largely on distinct islands. They were constructed a la Tenochtitlan with chinampas and so the city has a network of canals throughout. There are no walls, just numerous towers and large quays on the major shores. Districts include the Dockyard District (located along the Postjam River), the Housing District Othello to the West, the Housing District Iago to the East, the Government and City Center on the main island, the various specialized guild districts betwixt the Housing District Othello and the City Center. A small island exists in the middle of the Postjam River which acts as the toll booth for passing ships.
		</p>
    	<p>
			Every city block has a fountain for clean water, seen by many across the torus as an incredible luxury. Each home is equiped with a toilet tho that operates by pouring water down it to "flush". The cities sewers empty into a large marsh to the North of town and the pumps are operated by a very large clock-like pump. It is wound up when needed by huge water wheels that are powered by the river. The mechanism itself is located just outside the marsh as up until then, the sewer pipes flow downhill and are then brought up to the surface.
		</p>
        <p>
            Bridges connect the islands together, they are masoned stone arched bridges which allow for small boats to pass underneath. There 16 in total within the city as well as the East and West bridges. The intra city bridges have a guard tower at either end, city guards are posted at either side around the clock as the function as semi-police. The posted guards are the lowest rank, Public Guard. They wear red uniforms with yellow trim, they boast bastard swords as well as clubs. Posted at some bridges, rotating thruout the day, are the District Guards. They are fewer in number and wear Yellow uniforms with white trim. They have long swords and short bows. There are about a half dozen about during the day, but a full dozen at night.
        </p>
        <p>
            Architecture in Postjam Beach is world renowned. Skilled craftsman from across the torus were called for the remodeling. The light gray stones of the local area are polished and carved into minimalist streets but ornamental decorations. Stone oil lamps are placed incrementally along the Main Street as well as the River and marketplace. Red tiled roofs top every building with gutters and roofs shaped to utilize all rainwater. Large footpaths and cart paths interconnect the city with periodic squares and fountains. Along the banks of the canals there is around a 12 foot drop off with period ramps leading down to a second seris of footpaths outlining the waterways allowing for the potentional for dozens upon dozens of ships to load and unload anywhere along their shores.
        </p>
        <h3>Notable Buildings</h3>
        <p>
            City Hall is a large stone building at the center of town. Its most prominent feature is the public forum, a collection of stone benches all aligned facing a raised podium and two sets of seats, the Mayor and City Council use the later two respectively whenever they are having meetings. It's interior contains an office for each city council member as well as the second floor being the tax collectors office.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Trading Bureau's Office lies to the North-East of the central island and has been shut down since the summer of last year. The basement however is still maintained and guarded, albeit secretly. Sebastion uses it as his personal document storage and forgery headquarters to prevent any searches of his home from turning up any convicting evidence. Every night 3 elves go into the basement between midnight and 1:00 to do record keeping as well as forgery. They don't illuminate the building at all to hide their presence and rely on nightvision. A member of the PBLC patrols the building at night, in the general area, not directly at the building as to not draw attention. He was told that the other 3 elves are guarding the interior from having documents stolen by either the Montagues or the Capulets.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a small island in the middle of the Postjam River is the River Authority. The building is two stories tall and has many smaller outcroppings that handle the tariffing of ships as they pass thru town. It sits high on the island with the viaduct bridges on either side to allow for ships to pass underneath. A series of ramps and stairs lead down to a water-level dock of sorts to handle and direct or other affairs.
        </p>
        <h2>Demographics</h2>
        <hr class="style1">
        <p>
            As Postjam Beach is a frontier city, its demographics are skewed heavily toward human. It is however unique in being one of the most culturally diverse cities in Wendovia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 64% of the people are Human, 17% Gothe, 15% Dwarf, and 9% Kobold. This data comes from an official census taken by the government of Postjam Beach that asked "what do you identify yourself with" and listed the 4 races as the only options. It is well known that interbreeding is very widely practiced in Wendovia and so it should be taken into consideration when thinking about what race the populous is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the residents are "Workers for Hire" a concept that while currently unique to Postjam Beach and its "Immediate Vicinity Dependencies" whereby huge portions of the population belong to a large union-esque government run organization. They volunterily give data about their weight, height, muscle mass, lifting ability, intelligence, skills, etc. and when businesses need workers they go to employment offices run by the organization (called the Postjam Beach Laborers Coalition) and can select workers. The rest are mostly traders and masons. There are notably no farmers as there is no arable land in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city was founded by 4 families, the Capulets, Montagues, D'Otellos, and the D'Iagos. They settled on the banks of the river Postjam, claiming the settlement as originally Postjam By the Sea and later renamed to Postjam Beach. 
        </p>
        <h2>Government</h2>
        <hr class="style1">
        <p>
            The government of Postjam Beach is unable to be severed from the government of the surrounding towns. See Government of the United Municipalities for more info.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city government itself is largely under the sway of guilds. Elections happen every 6 years and the candidates allowed to run must be from noble families but are selected by the people in an STV style election.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the recent construction of the canals, sewer, and fountains throughout Postjam Beach, known as the Postjam Beach Waterstuff Project, taxes were raised on ships and goods passing through the city. This has caused a jump in black market activity and large scale corruption in the government. The Postjam Beach Laborers Coalition has decreased is at ~2/3 of what it was before the Waterstuff Project. There are currently large fears that the city could devolve into a situation similar to Arbornob.
        </p>
        <h3>Notable People/Groups</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>Othello D'Othello</h4>
            A feeble old man with a short white beard. He adorns himself in a teal cloack with white stained leather trim. He stands shorter than the average person and walks with a cane. He is the mayor of Postjam Beach and has been since before the reconstruction. In his youth he was a jeweler and used his wealth to finance his campaign. The line of D'Othellos was dying out, none bearing the name still remained after a terrible feaver killed the only remaining son, Othello's grand uncle. Othello changed his name from Romeo to Othello and his family name from Donviro to D'Othello and married his distant cousin Rosaline. They have birth to a single son who was sickly, due to complications with the birth, Rosaline died only a few days after.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Escalus D'Othello</h4>
            Sickly son of Othello, thin and lanky. He wears pale, muted green clothing and carries upon his person a assortment of pockets and pouches and bags containing notes and books and samples of gems and plants and spice. He is responsible for the maintenaince of the cities public works such as the fountains and canals and sewers, he is responsible for the daily bookeeping involving them as well. Because of his weakness he is accompanied by a strongman/guard named Alo. They have grown fond of each other and are secretly romantically involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Montagues</h4>
            one of the 4 families of Postjam Beach's nobility. They own timber fields in numerous surrdounding towns. They aim to consolodate the local areas by taking over the Postjam Goverment and restructuring the economy to focus on ship building, which would make them very wealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Capulets</h4>
            One of the 4 families of Postjam Beach's nobility. 30 years ago they unified with the D'Iagos after a terrible fever began wiping many of them out. Originally the Capulets headed the mints while the D'Iagos heading the banks but now after the unification, they run both. The 2 banks The Grand Bank and The D'Iago Standard Issue &amp; Company, are the only ones in Postjam Beach. They aim to keep Othello in power, have his sickly son marry Prospero's daughter Celia, uniting the D'Othello line. They also aim to use their political influence to make the Postjam Beach Laborers' Coalition no longer contracted out but the main laborers for spice gathering expeditions, coin minting, and banking, putting them directly under the government's control, having cheap, half priced labor.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Postjam Beach Laborers' Coalition</h4>
            Postjam Beach's economy is structured very differently from those of the east side of the mountains along with the other frontier towns of Wendovia. A large organization run by the government exists known as the Postjam Beach Laborer's Coalition (PBLC). Applicants fill out forms giving their information about weight, height, muscle mass, skills, talents, etc. to the agency which has "employment offices" around the city along with in surrounding towns. Anyone looking for laborers goes to the employment office and puts in a request and specifications of what they need and the PBLC sends them laborers who work at wages which are half paid for by the agency and half paid for by the employer. The salaries of the workers are covered by tariffs on passing ships.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Sebastion</h4>
            The head of the PBLC, secretly wants to become mayor himself and is also secretly militarizing the PBLC. He uses his influence to make the weapon purchases seem to be going thru the city itself instead of thru the PBLC. His former profession (a mime), makes him incredibly good at the art of mimicry and deception. He forges documents to fire his staff and have it appear to have come from the city gov, making the lay man unemployed, angry, and on his side as the one trying to protect the workers from tyrants. This also makes those still in the PBLC incredibly loyal. He currently has a somewhat unspoken agreement with Ariel as both are heavily involved in the black market. He publically pretends to be neutral, privately aligns himself with the Montagues who have funded the militarization of the PBLC for the revoltion, but secretly wants to use the PBLC as a military to overthrow the government and take power for himself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Prospero Capulet</h4>
            Head of the Capulet family and of the Banker Guild. He is in a plot to kepp the ill Othello in power and prop up his son Escalus while securing the necesseties of the Capulet banking scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Ariel</h4>
            high priestess of Postjam, wants Othello to remain in power. The clergy/"first estate" of postjam own all iron and precious metal refineries and smelteries in the city along with the spice works. She secretly runs a mob who deals in the black market, known for diguising goods so that passing ships will have to pay lower tariffs upon passing thru Postjam Beach.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Antonio Montague</h4>
            Red haired, bearded old man and head of the Montagues. Currently owns thousands of acres of timber around Postjam Beach and is personally funding, secretly, the militarization of the PBLC.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Mercutio</h4>
            song of Antonio, high general of the city guard in Postjam Beach.
