Bet on the wrong horse
Back the wrong horse
One horse town
Get off you high horse
Hold your horses
Pony up
Don't put the cart before the horse
Long in the tooth
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Straight from the horses mouth
Pony tails
HORSE - basketball game
Don't change horses midstream
Chomping at the bit
Horsepower - unit of measure
Wild goose chase
Flying fuck
To curry favor
Horseshit
Horseplay
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
That's a horse of a different color
Dark horse
So hungy I could eat a horse
No sense beating a dead horse
Charley horse
Run before your horse is to market
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse
Horse feathers
Trojan horse
A camel is a horse designed by a comittee
Across the board
Front runner
Hands down
Home stretch
Out of/In the running
Running mate
A run for one's money
Hoofing it
make hay while the sun is shining
one trick pony
wearing blinders
horsing around
put out to pasture
bareback
free rein
rein in
Down to the wire
Getting a leg up
Not my first rodeo
Hung like a horse
Got them eating out of the palm of my hand
Closing the stable door after the horse has bolted
Riding roughshod
Bring in the cavalry
Back in the saddle
Feeling your oats
One horse race
put it through its paces
shoe-in
You and the horse you rode in on
