* D&D Tables

These are tables that would be useful for combat.

I have tried to put the ones which will be referrenced most frequently at the top.


* Combat Modifiers
| Situation                 | Attack Roll Mod |
|---------------------------+-----------------|
| Attacker on high ground   |              +1 |
| Defender Invisible        |              -4 |
| Defender Off-balance      |              +2 |
| Defender Sleeping or Held |       Automatic |
| Defender Stunned or Prone |              +4 |
| Defender Surprised        |              +1 |
|---------------------------+-----------------|
| Missile fire, LONG        |              -5 |
| Missile fire, MEDIUM      |              +2 |
|---------------------------+-----------------|
| Rear Attack               |              +2 |


* Cover & Concealment
These numbers are added to the attack roll.

| Target is  | Cover | Concealment |
|------------+-------+-------------|
| 25% hidden |    -2 |          -1 |
| 50% hidden |    -4 |          -2 |
| 75% hidden |    -7 |          -3 |
| 90% hidden |   -10 |          -4 |

Hiding behind a wall offers cover, hiding in a thicket or bush offers concealment.


* Morale
This is a list of morale modifiers
remember that to make a morale roll, roll 2d6 and if it's higher than the Morale of the creature, it keeps fighting.

| Windspeed mph | Missile Combat | Melee Combat | Move v. Wind |
|---------------+----------------+--------------+--------------|
| 0 to 10       | -              |            - | -            |
| 11 to 20      | 0/-1/-2/-3     |            - | -            |

* Initiative Modifiers
Use these numbers whenever initiative is determined.

To qualify for a modifier, ALL MEMBERS must qualify.

| Situation                          | Mod |
|------------------------------------+-----|
| Hastened                           |  -2 |
| Slowed                             |  +2 |
| On High Ground                     |  -1 |
| Set to receive a charge            |  -2 |
| Wading/Slippery Footing            |  +2 |
| Wadding in deep water              |  +4 |
| Foreign Environment                |  +6 |
| Hindered (tangled, climbing, held) |  +3 |
| Waiting                            |  +1 |

A Foreign Environment would be something like swimming underwater. This is quite rare. Think of this as a modifer when some fundamental rules about fighting have changed.

Leather includes Padded Armor and Hides and Plate includes Bronze Plate.
