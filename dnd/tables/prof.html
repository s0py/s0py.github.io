<b style="color: #cc0000;">Agriculture: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0</b></em>The character has a knowledge of the basics<br>of farming. This includes planting, harvesting, storing crops,<br>tending animals, butchering, and other typical farming<br>chores.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Ancient History: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>The character has learned the legends,<br>lore, and history of some ancient time and place. The knowledge<br>must be specific, just as a historian would specialize<br>today in the English Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, or<br>the Roman Republic before Caesar. (The DM either can have<br>ancient periods in mind for his game or can allow the players<br>to name and designate them.) Thus, a player character could<br>know details about the Age of Thorac Dragonking or the Time<br>of the Sea-Raiders or whatever else was available.<br><br>The knowledge acquired gives the character familiarity<br>with the principal legends, historical events, characters, locations,<br>battles, breakthroughs (scientific, cultural, and magical),<br>unsolved mysteries, crafts, and oddities of the time. The character<br>must roll a proficiency check to identify places or things<br>he encounters from that age. For example, Rath knows quite<br>a bit about the Coming of the Trolls, a particularly dark period<br>of dwarven history. Moving through some deep caverns, he<br>and his companions stumble across an ancient portal, sealed<br>for untold ages. Studying the handiwork, he realizes (rolls a<br>successful proficiency check) that it bears several seals similar<br>to those he has seen on "banned" portals from the time of<br><br>Angnar, doorways to the legendary realm of Trolhel.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Animal Handling: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> -1 <br>Proficiency in this area enables a character<br>to exercise a greater-than-normal degree of control over<br>pack animals and beasts of burden. A successful proficiency<br>check indicates that the character has succeeded in calming<br>an excited or agitated animal; in contrast, a character without<br>this proficiency has only a 20% chance of succeeding in the<br>attempt.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Animal Lore: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>This proficiency enables a character to<br>observe the actions or habitat of an animal and interpret what<br>is going on. Actions can show how dangerous the creature is,<br>whether it is hungry, protecting its young, or defending a<br>nearby den. Furthermore, careful observation of signs and<br>behaviors can even indicate the location of a water hole, animal<br>herd, predator, or impending danger, such as a forest fire.<br><br>The DM will secretly roll a proficiency check. A successful<br>check means the character understood the basic actions of<br>the creature. If the check fails by 4 or less, no information is<br>gained. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character misinterprets<br>the actions of the animal.<br><br>A character may also imitate the calls and cries of animals<br>that he is reasonably familiar with, based on his background.<br><br>This ability is limited by volume. The roar of a tyrannosaurus<br>rex would be beyond the abilities of a normal character. A<br>successful proficiency check means that only magical means<br>can distinguish the character's call from that of the true animal.<br><br>The cry is sufficient to fool animals, perhaps frightening<br>them away or luring them closer. A failed check means the<br>sound is incorrect in some slight way. A failed call may still<br>fool some listeners, but creatures very familiar with the cry<br>automatically detect a false call. All other creatures and characters<br>are allowed a Wisdom check to detect the fake.<br><br>Finally, animal lore increases the chance of successfully<br>setting snares and traps (for hunting) since the character<br>knows the general habits of the creature hunted.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Animal Training: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>Characters with this proficiency can train<br>one type of creature (declared when the proficiency is chosen)<br>to obey simple commands and perform tricks. A character<br>can spend additional proficiencies to train other types of<br>creatures or can improve his skill with an already chosen type.<br><br>Creatures typically trained are dogs, horses, falcons, pigeons,<br>elephants, ferrets, and parrots. A character can choose even<br>more exotic creatures and monsters with animal intelligence<br>(although these are difficult to control).<br><br>A trainer can work with up to three creatures at one time.<br><br>The trainer may choose to teach general tasks or specific<br>tricks. A general task gives the creature the ability to react to a<br>number of nonspecific commands to do its job. Examples of<br>tasks include guard and attack, carry a rider, perform heavy<br>labor, hunt, track, or fight alongside soldiers (such as a war<br>horse or elephant). A specific trick teaches the trained creature<br>to do one specific action. A horse may rear on command,<br>a falcon may pluck a designated object, a dog may attack a<br>specific person, or a rat may run through a particular maze.<br><br>With enough time, a creature can be trained to do both general<br>tasks and specific tricks.<br><br>Training for a general task requires three months of uninterrupted<br>work. Training for a specific trick requires 2d6 weeks.<br><br>At the end of the training time, a proficiency check is made. If<br>successful, the animal is trained. If the die roll fails, the beast<br>is untrainable. An animal can be trained in 2d4 general tasks<br>or specific tricks, or any combination of the two.<br><br>An animal trainer can also try to tame wild animals (preparing<br>them for training later on). Wild animals can be tamed<br>only when they are very young. The taming requires one<br>month of uninterrupted work with the creature. At the end of<br>the month, a proficiency check is made. If successful, the<br>beast is suitable for training. If the check fails, the creature<br>retains enough of its wild behavior to make it untrainable. It<br>can be kept, though it must be leashed or caged.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Appraising: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>This proficiency is highly useful for thieves, as<br>it allows characters to estimate the value and authenticity of<br>antiques, art objects, jewelry, cut gemstones, or other crafted<br>items they find (although the DM can exclude those items<br>too exotic or rare to be well known). The character must<br>have the item in hand to examine. A successful proficiency<br>check (rolled by the DM) enables the character to estimate<br>the value of the item to the nearest 100 or 1,000 gp and to<br>identify fakes. On a failed check, the character cannot estimate<br>a price at all. On a roll of 20, the character wildly misreads<br>the value of the item, always to the detriment of the<br>character.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Armorer: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> -2<br>This character can make all of the types of armor<br>listed in the Player's Handbook, given the proper materials<br>and facilities. When making armor, the proficiency check is<br>rolled at the end of the normal construction time.<br><br>The time required to make armor is equal to two weeks<br>per level of AC below 10. For example, a shield would require<br>two weeks of work, whereas a suit of full plate armor would<br>require 18 weeks of work.<br><br>If the proficiency check indicates failure but is within 4 of<br>the amount needed for success, the armorer has created<br>usable, but flawed, armor. Such armor functions as 1 AC<br>worse than usual, although it looks like the armor it was<br>intended to be. Only a character with armorer proficiency can<br>detect the flaws, and this requires careful and detailed<br>inspection.<br><br>If the flawed armor is struck in melee combat with a natural<br>die roll of 19 or 20, it breaks. The character's AC immediately<br>worsens by 4 additional classes (although never above 10),<br>and the broken armor hampers the character's movement.<br><br>Until the character can remove the broken armor (a process<br>requiring 1d4 rounds), the character moves at 1/2 of his normal<br>rate and suffers a -4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.<br><br>If an armorer is creating a suit of field plate or full plate<br>armor, the character who will use the armor must be present<br>at least once a week during the creation of the armor, since<br>such types of armor require very exact fitting.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Artistic Ability: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>Player characters with artistic ability are<br>naturally accomplished in various forms of the arts. They have<br>an inherent understanding of color, form, space, flow, tone,<br>pitch, and rhythm. Characters with artistic ability must select<br>one art form (painting, sculpture, composition, etc.) to be<br>proficient in. Thereafter they can attempt to create art works<br>or musical compositions in their given field. Although it is not<br>necessary to make a proficiency check, one can be made to<br>determine the quality of the work. If a 1 is rolled on the check,<br>the artist has created a work with some truly lasting value. If<br>the check fails, the artist has created something aesthetically<br>unpleasing or just plain bad.<br><br>Artistic ability also confers a +1 bonus to all proficiency<br>checks requiring artistic skill--music or dance--and to<br>attempts to appraise objects of art.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Astrology: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>This proficiency gives the character some<br>understanding of the supposed influences of the stars.<br><br>Knowing the birth date and time of any person, the astrologer<br>can study the stars and celestial events and then prepare<br>a forecast of the future for that person. The astrologer's<br>insight into the future is limited to the next 30 days, and his<br>knowledge is vague at best. If a successful proficiency check<br>is made, the astrologer can foresee some general event--a<br>great battle, a friend lost, a new friendship made, etc. The<br><br>DM decides the exact prediction (based on his intentions for<br>the next few gaming sessions). Note that the prediction does<br>not guarantee the result--it only indicates the potential result.<br><br>If the proficiency check is failed, no information is gained<br>unless a 20 is rolled, in which case the prediction is wildly<br>inaccurate.<br><br>Clearly this proficiency requires preparation and advance<br>knowledge on the part of the DM. Because of this, it is permissible<br>for the DM to avoid the question, although this<br>shouldn't be done all the time. Players who want to make<br>their DM's life easier (always a good idea) should consider<br>using this proficiency at the end of a gaming session, giving<br>the DM until the next session to come up with an answer. The<br><br>DM can use this proficiency as a catalyst and guide for his<br>adventures--something that will prompt the player characters<br>to go to certain places or to try new things.<br><br>Characters with the astrology proficiency gain a +1 bonus<br>to all navigation proficiency checks, provided the stars can be<br>seen.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Blacksmithing: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Str    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>A character with blacksmithing proficiency<br>is capable of making tools and implements from iron. Use of<br>the proficiency requires a forge with a coal-fed fire and bellows,<br>as well as a hammer and anvil. The character cannot<br>make armor or most weapons, but can craft crowbars, grappling<br>hooks, horseshoes, nails, hinges, plows, and most other<br>iron objects.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Blind-fighting: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: NA    Check Mod:</b></em> NA<br>A character with blind-fighting is skilled at<br>fighting in conditions of poor or no light (but this proficiency<br>does not allow spell use). In total darkness, the character suffers<br>only a -2 penalty to his attack roll (as compared to a -4<br>penalty without this proficiency). Under starlight or moonlight,<br>the character incurs only a -1 penalty. The character suffers<br>no penalties to his AC because of darkness.<br><br>Furthermore, the character retains special abilities that would<br>normally be lost in darkness, although the effectiveness of these<br>are reduced by one-half (proficiency checks are made at half<br>the normal score, etc.). This proficiency is effective only against<br>opponents or threats within melee distance of the character.<br><br>Blind-fighting does not grant any special protection from missile<br>fire or anything outside the immediate range of the character's<br>melee weapon. Thus, AC penalties remain for missile fire. (By<br>the time the character hears the whoosh of the arrow, for<br>example, it is too late for him to react.)<br><br>While moving in darkness, the character suffers only half<br>the normal movement penalty of those without this proficiency.<br><br>Furthermore, this skill aids the character when dealing with<br>invisible creatures, reducing the attack penalty to -2. However,<br>it does not enable the character to discover invisible<br>creatures; he has only a general idea of their location and<br>cannot target them exactly.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Bowyer/Fletcher: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod: -1<br>This character can make bows and<br>arrows of the types given in Table 44.<br><br>A weaponsmith is required to fashion arrowheads, but the<br>bowyer/fletcher can perform all other necessary functions.<br><br>The construction time for a long or short bow is one week,<br>while composite bows require two weeks, and 1d6 arrows<br>can be made in one day.<br><br>When the construction time for the weapon is completed,<br>the player makes a proficiency check. If the check is successful,<br>the weapon is of fine quality and will last for many years<br>of normal use without breaking. If the check fails, the weapon<br>is still usable, but has a limited life span: An arrow breaks on<br>the first shot; a bow breaks if the character using it rolls an<br>unmodified 1 on his 1d20 attack roll.<br><br>Option:</b></em> If a character wishes to create a weapon of truly<br>fine quality and the DM allows it, the player can opt to use the<br>following alternative procedure for determining the success of<br>his attempt. When the proficiency check is made, any failure<br>means that the weapon is useless. However, a successful<br>check means that the weapon enables the character to add<br><br>Strength bonuses to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, if<br>the proficiency check is a natural 1, the range of the bow is<br>increased 10 yards for all range classes or is of such fine work<br>that it is suitable for enchantment.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Brewing: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: 0<br>The character is trained in the art of brewing<br>beers and other strong drink. The character can prepare brewing<br>formulas, select quality ingredients, set up and manage a<br>brewery, control fermentation, and age the finished product.<br><br>Carpentry: The carpentry proficiency enables the character<br>to do woodworking jobs:</b></em> building houses, cabinetry, joinery,<br>etc. Tools and materials must be available. The character<br>can build basic items from experience, without the need for<br>plans. Unusual and more complicated items (a catapult, for<br>example) require plans prepared by an engineer. Truly<br>unusual or highly complex items (wooden clockwork mechanisms,<br>for example) require a proficiency check.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Charioteering: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>A character with proficiency in this skill is<br>able to safely guide a chariot, over any type of terrain that can<br>normally be negotiated, at a rate one-third faster than the<br>normal movement rate for a chariot driven by a character<br>without this proficiency. Note that this proficiency does not<br>impart the ability to move a chariot over terrain that it cannot<br>traverse; even the best charioteer in the world cannot take<br>such a vehicle into the mountains.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Cobbling: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>The character can fashion and repair shoes,<br>boots, and sandals.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Cooking: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>Although all characters have rudimentary cooking<br>skills, the character with this proficiency is an accomplished<br>cook. A proficiency check is required only when<br>attempting to prepare a truly magnificent meal worthy of a<br>master chef.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Dancing: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>The character knows many styles and varieties<br>of dance, from folk dances to formal court balls.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Direction Sense: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> +1<br>A character with this proficiency has an<br>innate sense of direction. By concentrating for 1d6 rounds,<br>the character can try to determine the direction the party is<br>headed. If the check fails but is less than 20, the character<br>errs by 90 degrees. If a 20 is rolled, the direction chosen is<br>exactly opposite the true heading. (The DM rolls the check.)<br><br>Furthermore, when traveling in the wilderness, a character<br>with direction sense has the chance of becoming lost reduced<br>by 5%.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Disguise: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>The character with this skill is trained in the art<br>of disguise. He can make himself look like any general type of<br>person of about the same height, age, weight, and race. A<br>successful proficiency check indicates that the disguise is successful,<br>while a failed roll means the attempt was too obvious<br>in some way.<br><br>The character can also disguise himself as a member of<br>another race or sex. In this case, a -7 penalty is applied to the<br>proficiency check. The character may also attempt to disguise<br>himself as a specific person, with a -10 penalty to the proficiency<br>check. These modifiers are cumulative, thus, it is<br>extremely difficult for a character to disguise himself as a<br>specific person of another race or sex (a -17 penalty to the<br>check).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Endurance: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Con    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>A character with endurance proficiency is able<br>to perform continual strenuous physical activity for twice as<br>long as a normal character before becoming subject to the<br>effects of fatigue and exhaustion. In those cases where<br>extreme endurance is required, a successful proficiency check<br>must be made. Note that this proficiency does not enable a<br>character to extend the length of time that he can remain<br>unaffected by a lack of food or water.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Engineering: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> -3<br>The character is trained as a builder of both<br>great and small things. Engineers can prepare plans for everything<br>from simple machines (catapults, river locks, grist mills)<br>to large buildings (fortresses, dams). A proficiency check is<br>required only when designing something particularly complicated<br>or unusual. An engineer must still find talented workmen<br>to carry out his plan, but he is trained to supervise and<br>manage their work.<br><br>An engineer is also familiar with the principles of siegecraft<br>and can detect flaws in the defenses of a castle or similar<br>construction. He knows how to construct and use siege<br>weapons and machines, such as catapults, rams, and screws.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Etiquette: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>This proficiency gives the character a basic<br>understanding of the proper forms of behavior and address<br>required in many different situations, especially those involving<br>nobility and persons of rank. Thus, the character will know<br>the correct title to use when addressing a duke, the proper<br>steps of ceremony to greet visiting diplomats, gestures to<br>avoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual<br>occurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character<br>to know the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial<br>visit, for example, is a sufficiently rare event).<br><br>However, having the character know what is correct and<br>actually do what is correct are two different matters. The<br>encounters must still be role-played by the character. Knowledge<br>of etiquette does not give the character protection from<br>a gaffe or faux pas; many people who know the correct thing<br>still manage to do the exact opposite.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Fire-building: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>A character with fire-building proficiency<br>does not normally need a tinderbox to start a fire. Given some<br>dry wood and small pieces of tinder, he can start a fire in<br>2d20 minutes. Flint and steel are not required. Wet wood,<br>high winds, or other adverse conditions increase the time to<br>3d20, and a successful proficiency check must be rolled to<br>start a fire.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Fishing: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>The character is skilled in the art of fishing, be it<br>with hook and line, net, or spear. Each hour the character<br>spends fishing, roll a proficiency check. If the roll is failed, no<br>fish are caught that hour. Otherwise, a hook and line or a<br>spear will land fish equal to the difference between the die<br>roll and the character's Wisdom score. A net will catch three<br>times this amount.<br><br>Of course, no fish can be caught where no fish are found.<br><br>On the other hand, some areas teem with fish, such as a river<br>or pool during spawning season. The DM may modify the<br>results according to the situation.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Forgery: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>This proficiency enables the character to create<br>duplicates of documents and handwriting and to detect such<br>forgeries created by others. To forge a document (military<br>orders, local decrees, etc.) where the handwriting is not specific<br>to a person, the character needs only to have seen a<br>similar document before. To forge a name, an autograph of<br>that person is needed, and a proficiency check with a -2<br>penalty must be successfully rolled. To forge a longer document<br>written in the hand of some particular person, a large<br>sample of his handwriting is needed, with a -3 penalty to the<br>check.<br><br>It is important to note that the forger always thinks he has<br>been successful; the DM rolls the character's proficiency<br>check in secret and the forger does not learn of a failure until<br>it is too late.<br><br>If the check succeeds, the work will pass examination by<br>all except those intimately familiar with that handwriting or by<br>those with the forgery proficiency who examine the document<br>carefully. If the check is failed, the forgery is detectable<br>to anyone familiar with the type of document or handwriting--<br>if he examines the document closely. If the die roll is a<br>20, the forgery is immediately detectable to anyone who<br>normally handles such documents without close examination.<br><br>The forger will not realize this until too late.<br><br>Furthermore, those with forgery proficiency may examine<br>a document to learn if it is a forgery. On a successful proficiency<br>roll, the authenticity of any document can be ascertained.<br><br>If the die roll is failed but a 20 is not rolled, the<br>answer is unknown. If a 20 is rolled, the character reaches<br>the incorrect conclusion.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Gaming: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>The character knows most common games of<br>chance and skill, including cards, dice, bones, draughts, and<br>chess. When playing a game, the character may either play<br>out the actual game (which may take too much time for<br>some) or make a proficiency check, with success indicating<br>victory. If two proficient characters play each other, the one<br>with the highest successful die roll wins. A character with<br>gaming proficiency can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a<br>+1 bonus to his ability score. If the proficiency check for the<br>game is 17 to 20, however, the character has been caught<br>cheating (even if he won the game).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Gem Cutting: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> -2<br>A character with this proficiency can finish<br>the rough gems that are discovered through mining at a rate<br>of 1d10 stones per day. A gem cutter derives no benefit from<br>the assistance of nonproficient characters. A gem cutter must<br>work with a good light source and must have an assortment<br>of chisels, small hammers, and specially hardened blades.<br><br>Uncut gems, while still of value, are not nearly as valuable<br>as the finished product. If the cutting is successful (as determined<br>by a proficiency check), the gem cutter increases the<br>value of a given stone to the range appropriate for its type. If<br>a 1 is rolled, the work is exceptionally brilliant and the value<br>of the gem falls into the range for the next most valuable gem<br>(the DM has the relevant tables).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Healing: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> -2<br>A character proficient in healing knows how to<br>use natural medicines and basic principles of first aid and<br>doctoring. If the character tends another within one round of<br>wounding (and makes a successful proficiency check), his<br>ministrations restore 1d3 hit points (but no more hit points<br>can be restored than were lost in the previous round). Only<br>one healing attempt can be made on a character per day.<br><br>If a wounded character remains under the care of someone<br>with healing proficiency, that character can recover lost<br>hit points at the rate of 1 per day even when traveling or<br>engaging in nonstrenuous activity. If the wounded character<br>gets complete rest, he can recover 2 hit points per day while<br>under such care. Only characters with both healing and herbalism<br>proficiencies can help others recover at the rate of 3 hit<br>points per day of rest. This care does not require a proficiency<br>check, only the regular attention of the proficient character.<br><br>Up to six patients can be cared for at any time.<br><br>A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to<br>aid a poisoned individual, provided the poison entered<br>through a wound. If the poisoned character can be tended to<br>immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and<br>the care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a<br>+2 bonus to his saving throw (delay his saving throw until<br>the last round of tending). No proficiency check is required,<br>but the poisoned character must be tended to immediately<br>(normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient<br>character) and cannot do anything himself. If the care and<br>rest are interrupted, the poisoned character must immediately<br>roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is<br>unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't<br>help). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies<br>can attempt the same treatment for poisons the<br>victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his<br>healing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge<br>to prepare a purgative).<br><br>A character with healing proficiency can also attempt to<br>diagnose and treat diseases. When dealing with normal diseases,<br>a successful proficiency check automatically reduces<br>the disease to its mildest form and shortest duration. Those<br>who also have herbalism knowledge gain an additional +2<br>bonus to this check. A proficient character can also attempt<br>to deal with magical diseases, whether caused by spells or<br>creatures. In this case, a successful proficiency check diagnoses<br>the cause of the disease. However, since the disease is<br>magical in nature, it can be treated only by magical means.

Heraldry comes in many forms<br>and is used for many different purposes. It can be used to<br>identify noblemen, families, guilds, sects, legions, political<br>factions, and castes. The symbols may appear on flags,<br>shields, helmets, badges, embroidery, standards, clothing,<br>coins, and more. The symbols used may include geometric<br>patterns, calligraphed lines of script, fantastic beasts, religious<br>symbols, and magical seals (made for the express purpose<br>of identification). Heraldry can vary from the highly formalized<br>rules and regulations of late medieval Europe to the<br>knowledge of different shield patterns and shapes used by<br><br>African tribesmen.<br><br>The character automatically knows the different heraldic<br>symbols of his homeland and whom they are associated with.<br><br>In addition, if the character makes a successful proficiency<br>check, he can correctly identify the signs and symbols of other<br>lands, provided he has at least a passing knowledge of the<br>inhabitants of that land. His heraldry skill is of little use upon<br>first entering a foreign land.

They can also prepare<br>natural plant poisons and purgatives. The DM must<br>decide the exact strength of such poisons based on the poison<br>rules in the DMG. A character with both herbalism and<br>healing proficiencies gains bonuses when using his healing<br>talent (see the Healing proficiency).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Hunting: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>When in wilderness settings, the character can<br>attempt to stalk and bring down game. A proficiency check<br>must be made with a -1 penalty to the ability score for every<br>nonproficient hunter in the party. If the die roll is successful,<br>the hunter (and those with him) have come within 101 to<br>200 yards (100+1d100) of an animal. The group can<br>attempt to close the range, but a proficiency check must be<br>made for each 20 yards closed. If the stalking is successful,<br>the hunter automatically surprises the game. The type of animal<br>stalked depends on the nature of the terrain and the<br>whim of the DM.

A check is made when trying spectacular<br>tricks ("Watch me eat this apple in mid-air!").<br><br>However, juggling also enables the character to attempt<br>desperate moves. On a successful attack roll vs. AC 0 (not a<br>proficiency check), the character can catch small items<br>thrown to harm him (as opposed to items thrown for him to<br>catch). Thus, the character could catch a dagger or a dart<br>before it hits. If this attack roll fails, however, the character<br>automatically suffers damage (sticking your hand in the path<br>of a dagger is likely to hurt)
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Jumping: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Str    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>The character can attempt exceptional leaps<br>both vertically and horizontally. If the character has at least a<br>20-foot running start, he can leap (broad jump) 2d6+his<br>level in feet. No character can broad jump more than six<br>times his height, however. With the same start, he can leap<br>vertically (high jump) 1d3 plus half his level in feet. No character<br>can high jump more than 11/2 times his own height.<br><br>From a standing start, a character with this proficiency can<br>broad jump 1d6 plus half his level in feet and high jump only<br>3 feet.<br><br>The character can also attempt vaults using a pole. A vault<br>requires at least a 30-foot running start. If a pole is used, it<br>must be 4 to 10 feet longer than the character's height. The<br>vault spans a distance equal to 11/2 times the length of the<br>pole. The character can clear heights equal to the height of<br>the pole. He can also choose to land on his feet if the vault<br>carries him over an obstacle no higher than 1/2 the height of his<br>pole. Thus, using a 12-foot pole, the character could either<br>vault through a window 12 feet off the ground (tumbling into<br>the room beyond), land on his feet in an opening 6 feet off<br>the ground, or vault across a moat 18 feet wide. In all cases,<br>the pole is dropped at the end of the vault.

Furthermore,<br>the character can try to retell these events as entertaining<br>stories. Once the subject is chosen, he can either make a<br>proficiency check and, if successful, add that tale to his repertoire,<br>or actually tell the story to other characters. If the character<br>succeeds in entertaining them, the player need not<br>make a proficiency roll for the character, since he has succeeded.<br><br>The character can tell these stories to entertain others,<br>granting him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the<br>encounter.

First, the character<br>can attempt to determine what types of ores or gems<br>can be found in a given area. To do this, he must spend at<br>least a week searching a four-square-mile area. The DM may<br>rule that more area must be searched to find anything of<br>value and may thus increase the amount of time required. At<br>the end of the search, the character can say what is likely to<br>be found in this area. After this, the character can site the<br>mine. On a successful proficiency check (made secretly by<br>the DM), the character has found a good site to begin mining<br>for any minerals that may be in the area. The check does not<br>guarantee a successful mine, only that a particular site is the<br>best choice in a given area. The DM must determine what<br>minerals, if any, are to be found in the region of the mine. On<br>a failed check, the character only thinks he has found a good<br>site. Much effort is spent before the character is proved<br>wrong, of course.<br><br>Once the mine is in operation, a character with mining<br>proficiency must remain on site to supervise all work. Although<br>this is a steady job, most player characters will find it better to<br>hire an NPC for this purpose.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Mountaineering: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: NA    Check Mod:</b></em> NA<br>A character with this proficiency can<br>make difficult and dangerous climbs up steep slopes and<br>cliffs with the aid of spikes, ropes, etc. If a character with<br>mountaineering proficiency leads a party, placing the pitons<br>(spikes) and guiding the others, all in the party can gain the<br>benefit of his knowledge. A mountaineer can guide a party up<br>a cliff face it could not otherwise climb. A character with this<br>proficiency gains a 10% bonus per proficiency slot spent to<br>his chance to climb any surface. Note that mountaineering is<br>not the same as the thief's climbing ability, since the latter<br>does not require aids of any sort.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Musical Instrument: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> -1<br>The character can play a specific<br>musical instrument. An additional instrument can be added<br>for every extra slot devoted to this proficiency. The character<br>plays quite well, and no proficiency check is normally<br>required. The DM may direct the character to make a proficiency<br>check in what he feels are extraordinary circumstances.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Navigation: <br></b><em>Slots:     Relevant Ability:     Check Mod:</b></em> <br>The character has learned the arts of navigating<br>by the stars, studying currents, and watching for telltale<br>signs of land, reefs, and hidden danger. This is not particularly<br>useful on land. At sea, a successful proficiency check by the<br>navigator reduces the chance of getting lost by 20 percent.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Pottery: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> -2<br>A character with this proficiency can create any<br>type of clay vessel or container commonly used in the campaign<br>world. The character requires a wheel and a kiln, as well<br>as a supply of clay and glaze. The character can generally<br>create two small- or medium-sized items or one large-sized<br>item per day. The pieces of pottery must then be fired in the<br>kiln for an additional day.<br><br>The raw materials involved cost 3 cp to make a small<br>item, 5 cp to make a medium-sized item, and 1 sp to make<br>a large item.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Reading Lips: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> -2<br>The character can understand the speech of<br>those he can see but not hear. When this proficiency is chosen,<br>the player must specify what language the character can lip<br>read (it must be a language the character can already speak).<br><br>To use the proficiency, the character must be within 30 feet of<br>the speaker and be able to see him speak. A proficiency check<br>is made. If the check fails, nothing is learned. If the check is<br>successful, 70% of the conversation is understood. Since certain<br>sounds are impossible to differentiate, the understanding<br>of a lip-read conversation is never better than this.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Reading/Writing: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> +1<br>The character can read and write a<br>modern language he can speak, provided there is someone<br>available to teach the character (another PC, a hireling, or an<br><br>NPC). This proficiency does not enable the character to read<br>ancient languages (see Languages, Ancient).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Religion: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>Characters with religion proficiency know the<br>common beliefs and cults of their homeland and the major<br>faiths of neighboring regions. Ordinary information (type of<br>religious symbol used, basic attitude of the faith, etc.) of any<br>religion is automatically known by the character. Special information,<br>such as how the clergy is organized or the significance<br>of particular holy days, requires a proficiency check.<br><br>Additional proficiencies spent on religion enable the character<br>either to expand his general knowledge into more distant<br>regions (using the guidelines above) or to gain precise<br>information about a single faith. If the latter is chosen, the<br>character is no longer required to make a proficiency check<br>when answering questions about that religion. Such expert<br>knowledge is highly useful to priest characters when dealing<br>with their own and rival faiths.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Riding, Airborne: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Wis    Check Mod: -2<br>The character is trained in handling a<br>flying mount. The particular creature must be chosen when<br>the proficiency is chosen. Additional proficiency slots can be<br>used to learn how to handle other types of mounts. Unlike<br>land-based riding, a character must have this proficiency (or<br>ride with someone who does) to handle a flying mount. In<br>addition, a proficient character can do the following:</b></em><br>- Leap onto the saddle of the creature (when it is standing on<br>the ground) and spur it airborne as a single action. This<br>requires no proficiency check.<br>- Leap from the back of the mount and drop 10 feet to the<br>ground or onto the back of another mount (land-based or<br>flying). Those with only light encumbrance can drop to the<br>ground without a proficiency check. In all other situations, a<br>proficiency check is required. A failed roll means the character<br>takes normal falling damage (for falling flat on his face)<br>or misses his target (perhaps taking large amounts of damage<br>as a result). A character who is dropping to the ground<br>can attempt an immediate melee attack, if his proficiency<br>check is made with a -4 penalty to the ability roll. Failure<br>has the consequences given above.<br>- Spur his mount to greater speeds on a successful check,<br>adding 1d4 to the movement rate of the mount. This speed<br>can be maintained for four consecutive rounds. If the check<br>fails, an attempt can be made again the next round. If two<br>checks fail, no attempt can be made for a full turn. After the<br>rounds of increased speed, its movement drops to 2/3 its<br>normal rate and its Maneuverability Class (see Glossary)<br>becomes one class worse. These conditions last until the<br>mount lands and is allowed to rest for at least one hour.<br>- The rider can guide the mount with his knees and feet,<br>keeping his hands free. A proficiency check is made only<br>after the character suffers damage. If the check is failed, the<br>character is knocked from the saddle. A second check is<br>allowed to see if the character manages to catch himself<br>(thus hanging from the side by one hand or in some equally<br>perilous position). If this fails, the rider falls. Of course a<br>rider can strap himself into the saddle, although this could<br>be a disadvantage if his mount is slain and plummets<br>toward the ground.

He must also make a proficiency check<br>if he attempts to vault onto the saddle of a moving mount.<br><br>Failure indicates that the character falls to the ground--presumably<br>quite embarrassed.<br>- The character can urge the mount to jump tall obstacles or<br>leap across gaps. No check is required if the obstacle is less<br>than 3 feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet wide. If the<br>character wants to roll a proficiency check, the mount can be<br>urged to leap obstacles up to 7 feet high, or jump across<br>gaps up to 30 feet wide. Success means that the mount has<br>made the jump. Failure indicates that it balks, and the character<br>must make another proficiency check to see whether he<br>retains his seat or falls to the ground.<br>- The character can spur his steed on to great speeds, adding<br>6 feet per round to the animal's movement rate for up to<br>four turns. This requires a proficiency check each turn to see<br>if the mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial check<br>fails, no further attempts may be made, but the mount can<br>move normally. If the second or subsequent check fails, the<br>mount immediately slows to a walk, and the character must<br>dismount and lead the animal for a turn. In any event, after<br>four turns of racing, the steed must be walked by its dismounted<br>rider for one turn.<br>- The character can guide his mount with his knees,<br>enabling him to use weapons that require two hands<br>(such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted.<br><br>This feat does not require a proficiency check unless the<br>character takes damage while so riding. In this case, a<br>check is required and failure means that the character<br>falls to the ground and sustains an additional 1d6 points<br>of damage.<br>- The character can drop down and hand alongside the<br>steed, using it as a shield against attack. The character cannot<br>make an attack or wear armor while performing this<br>feat. The character's Armor Class is lowered by 6 while this<br>maneuver is performed. Any attacks that would have<br>struck the character's normal Armor Class are considered<br>to have struck the mount instead. No proficiency check is<br>required.<br><br>The character can leap from the back of his steed to the<br>ground and make a melee attack against any character or<br>creature within 10 feet. The player must roll a successful<br>proficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On a failed<br>roll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to<br>the ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.

These can include rope<br>snares and spring traps. A proficiency check must be rolled<br>when the snare is first constructed and every time the snare<br>is set. A failed proficiency check means the trap does not<br>work for some reason. It may be that the workmanship was<br>bad, the character left too much scent in the area, or he<br>poorly concealed the finished work. The exact nature of the<br>problem does not need to be known. The character can also<br>attempt to set traps and snares for larger creatures:</b></em> tiger pits<br>and net snares, for example. A proficiency check must be<br>rolled, this time with a -4 penalty to the ability score. In both<br>cases, setting a successful snare does not ensure that it<br>catches anything, only that the snare works if triggered. The<br><br>DM must decide if the trap is triggered.<br><br>Thief characters (and only thieves) with this proficiency<br>can also attempt to rig man-traps.

A proficiency check must be rolled to<br>make a correct identification. Wizard specialists gain a +3<br>bonus to the check when attempting to identify magic of their<br>own school. Note that since the spellcaster must be observed<br>until the very instant of casting, the spellcraft proficiency does<br>not grant an advantage against combat spells.

They can hold<br>their breath and float, but they cannot move themselves<br>about in the water
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Tightrope Walking: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>The character can attempt to walk narrow<br>ropes or beams with greater than normal chances of<br>success. He can negotiate any narrow surface not angled up<br>or down greater than 45 degrees. Each round the character<br>can walk 60 feet. One proficiency check is made every 60<br>feet (or part thereof), with failure indicating a fall. The check<br>is made with a -10 penalty to the ability score if the surface<br>is 1 inch or less in width (a rope), a -5 penalty if 2 inches to<br>6 inches wide, and unmodified if 7 inches to 12 inches wide.<br><br>Wider than 1 foot requires no check for proficient characters<br>under normal circumstances. Every additional proficiency<br>spent on tightrope walking reduces these penalties by 1. Use<br>of a balancing rod reduces the penalties by 2. Winds or vibrations<br>in the line increases the penalties by 2 to 6.<br><br>The character can attempt to fight while on a tightrope, but<br>he suffers a -5 penalty to his attack roll and must roll a successful<br>proficiency check at the beginning of each round to<br>avoid falling off. Since the character cannot maneuver, he<br>gains no adjustments to his Armor Class for Dexterity. If he is<br>struck while on the rope, he must roll an immediate proficiency<br>check to retain his balance.
<b style="color: #cc0000;">Acting:</b></em> <br>Acting enables a character to skillfully portray<br>various roles. Acting is most often used<br>as a form of entertainment; it can also be useful<br>in aiding a disguise. If both acting and disguise<br>are known, the proficiency check for<br>either is made with a +1 bonus.<br>Proficiency checks are required only if the<br>actor must portray a particularly difficult<br>character or is attempting an \"ad lib\" role<br>(i.e., a nonrehearsed role or on short notice).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Chanting:</b></em> <br>The character is an accomplished chanter<br>and can use this ability to help fellow workers<br>or soldiers keep pace. Proficiency checks are<br>used to determine the effectiveness of the<br>chanting.<br><br>On a successful proficiency check, those<br>who can hear the chanter become slightly<br>hypnotized by the rhythmic sound, causing<br>the time spent on arduous, repetitive tasks to<br>pass quickly. The DM can, at his option, adjust<br>results for forced marching, rowing, digging,<br>and other such tasks accordingly.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Craft Instrument:</b></em> <br>Those who take this proficiency must specify<br>whether they are skilled at crafting wind,<br>stringed, percussion, or keyboard instruments.<br>It takes an additional proficiency slot<br>to gain one of the other skills. Three additional<br>slots allow the character to take the title<br>\"master craftsman\" as he is able to craft instruments<br>of all forms.<br><br>A craftsman must buy materials equal to a<br>quarter of the instrument's sale value. It then<br>takes ld6 days to craft a wind or percussion<br>instrument, 2d8 days to form a stringed in-<br>strument, and 3d10 day to create a keyboard<br>instrument. These times assume that the<br>craftsman is spending 10 hours a day working<br>on the instrument. If craftsman tools (cost 25<br>gp, weight 5 pounds) are not available, all<br>times are doubled.<br><br>The quality of an instrument is determined<br>by a final proficiency check. Failure results in<br>an instrument of poor quality, while success<br>indicates good quality. A natural 20 indicates<br>that the instrument is nonfunctional, while a<br>natural 1 results in a masterpiece worth twice<br>the normal value.<br><br>Simple repairs take only ld4 hours and re-<br>quire no proficiency check unless the proper<br>tools are not available. However, repairing severe<br>damage requires Id8 hours and a check is<br>mandatory for success.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Crowd Working:</b></em> <br>Almost every bard is familiar with the ways<br>of a crowd. However, those who take crowd<br>working learn all the tricks of the trade. Such<br>bards are skilled at observing crowds and adjusting<br>their performances accordingly.<br><br>Any bard who is using a special ability to<br>adjust the encounter reactions of a crowd<br>(e.g., influence reactions) can make a crowd<br>working proficiency check. If this check is<br>successful, the bard can alter the reactions of<br>the crowd by two levels instead of the typical<br>one.<br><br>If the bard or his group is soliciting money<br>from a crowd, a successful proficiency check<br>indicates that the bard is particularly appealing<br>and the crowd willingly donates twice as<br>much money as it normally would (or conditions<br>improve one category if using the performance<br>rules earlier in this handbook).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Poetry:</b></em> <br>Proficiency in poetry includes the skills of<br>reciting poetry and judging its quality. It also<br>indicates that the character has a repertoire of<br>poems memorized for recital at any time. No<br>proficiency check is required for a normal<br>recital.<br><br>If the character can read and write, original<br>poems can be written. A successful proficiency<br>check indicates that the poem is of above<br>average quality.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Whitsling/Humming:</b></em> <br>Almost anyone can whistle or hum. Those<br>who take this proficiency are exceptional<br>whistlers and hummers. They can produce<br>tunes as captivating as most songs. A person<br>with this proficiency is a true master whistler<br>and hummer.<br><br>It is so easy to learn a new tune to whistle or<br>hum that characters with this proficiency can<br>learn numerous tunes. In fact, if a proficiency<br>check is made, a whistler or hummer knows<br>any particular tune in question. In addition, a<br>character with both this proficiency and the<br>animal lore proficiency can mimic any bird<br>call he has heard.<br><br>However, most adventurers do not take<br>whistling just for the entertainment value. Instead,<br>they are looking for its uses in communication.<br>This communication is possible<br>only among those who know this proficiency.<br>If both characters succeed with their proficiency<br>checks, a single concept can be communicated.<br>Some examples are \"Go around to the<br>side door,\" \"I hear them coming,\" \"Slowly<br>reach out now, the guard doesn't see you.\"

Aside from entertaining, the character<br>with tumbling proficiency can improve his Armor Class by 4<br>against attacks directed solely at him in any round of combat,<br>provided he has the initiative and foregoes all attacks that<br>round. When in unarmed combat he can improve his attack<br>roll by 2.<br><br>On a successful proficiency check, he suffers only one-half<br>the normal damage from falls of 60 feet or less and none<br>from falls of 10 feet or less.

<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Ventriloquism: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod: -2<br>The character has learned the secrets of<br>"throwing his voice." Although not actually making sound come<br>from somewhere else (like the spell), the character can deceive<br>others into believing this to be so. When using ventriloquism,<br>the supposed source of the sound must be relatively close to<br>the character. The nature of the speaking object and the intelligence<br>of those watching can modify the character's chance of<br>success. If the character makes an obviously inanimate object<br>talk (a book, mug, etc.), a -5 penalty is applied to his ability<br>score. If a believable source (a PC or NPC) is made to appear to<br>speak, a +2 bonus is added to his ability score.

One check must be<br>made for every sentence or response. The character is limited<br>to sounds he could normally make (thus, the roar of a lion is<br>somewhat beyond him).<br><br>Since ventriloquism relies on deception, people's knowledge<br>of speech, and assumptions about what should and<br>shouldn't talk, it is effective only on intelligent creatures.<br><br>Thus, it has no effect on animals and the like. Furthermore,<br>the audience must be watching the character since part of<br>the deception is visual ("Hey, his lips don't move!"). Using<br>ventriloquism to get someone to look behind him does not<br>work, since the voice is not actually behind him (this requires<br>the ventriloquism spell).

However, for every six hours of observation, the character<br>gains a +1 bonus to his ability score (as he watches the<br>weather change, the character gets a better sense of what is<br>coming).

<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Intimidation: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Special    Check Mod: Special<br>This is a talent for bending people to<br>your will by scaring the living daylights<br>out of them. NPCs who are intimidated<br>are quite likely to do what they're told,<br>out of fear. On the negative side, they<br>are also very likely to harbor much resentment<br>against the character that intimidates<br>them. The NPCs will keep<br>their resentment hidden-until the first<br>chance to avenge their pride arises.<br><br>Intimidation may be attempted with<br>one of two abilities:</b></em> Strength or Charisma.<br>If Strength is used, the thief is<br>threatening immediate, personal bodily<br>harm. If Charisma is used, the intimidation<br>consists of more subtle threats,<br>which need not be physical. If successful,<br>the NPC is convinced that the thief<br>is ready and capable of makii his life<br>miserable-if not immediately, then in<br>the near future.<br><br>Player characters are never forced to<br>submit to intimidation, as this would<br>detract from the players' freedom to<br>role-play.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Locksmithing: <br> </b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>This is the specialized skill of making locks.<br>It is treated like other 'craft' proficiencies<br>when checking for success. Also, theieves with<br>this proficiency gain a 10% bonus to their<br>lockpicking skill, because they are intimately<br>familiar with the internal structure and work-<br>ing of so many locks.<br><br>Besides troubleshooters, dwarf and gnome<br>thieves of any kit can take the locksmithing<br>proficiency to fill one slot, because the<br>tradition of crasftsmanship and mechanical<br>things in their cultural heritages.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Looting: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>This proficiency represents a knack<br>for grabbing the best loot in the shortest<br>time. For instance, a cat burglar breaks<br>into a room in a wealthy mansion. He<br>has about two minutes to fill his backpack,<br>so that he can escape before<br>guards are summoned by magical<br>alarms. If his proficiency check succeeds,<br>he is able to recognize and stuff<br>into his pack the most valuable combination<br>of items that is feasible, given his<br>limitations of time and space.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Observation: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Int    Check Mod:</b></em> 0<br>Characters with this proficiency have<br>cultivated exceptionally acute powers<br>of observation. The DM may ask for a<br>proficiency check (or secretly roll it<br>himself) anytime there is something<br>subtly askew; he may also allow characters<br>with observation to increase<br>their chance of finding secret or concealed<br>doors by 1 in 6. The proficiency<br>covers all the senses.
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Trailing: <br></b><em>Slots: 1    Relevant Ability: Dex    Check Mod:</b></em> Special<br>Trailing resembles tracking, except<br>tracking is associated chiefly with the<br>wilderness, and trailing typically is<br>used in major urban centers (i.e., cities<br>and large towns). It is the talent of tailing<br>someone-of keeping a certain die<br>tance or even catching up to them,<br>though they may be attempting to<br>blend into a crowd, or at least get lost in<br>the confusion of a street full of people.<br><br>A proficiency check is first made to<br>see if the thief is able to trail without being<br>noticed. If the person followed has<br>the alertness proficiency, then the thief<br>suffers a -5 penalty.<br><br>If the thief is noticed, the person being<br>followed may attempt to evade. To<br>keep from losing the trail, the thief must<br>make another proficiency check. A<br>modifier from -3 to +3 (vatying from<br>first time in a foreign city to the thief's<br>home neighborhood) may be used, if<br>the DM so chooses, to reflect how well<br>the thief knows the area. Warn the<br>player beforehand if you will apply<br>modifiers (though you needn't tell exactly<br>what they are).<br><br>The DM should feel free to use situational<br>modifiers on these rolls. For example,<br>if a street is relatively dear, the<br>thief should get -1 or -2 on an attempt<br>to follow unnoticed, but +1 or<br>+ 2 if he has been seen and is chasing after<br>his subject. The opposite numbers<br>could be used for exceptionally<br>crowded situations, or at night.<br>For any Trailing proficiency roll, a<br>-3 penalty applies if the person followed<br>has the Trailing proficiency as<br>well (and, presumably, knows better<br>how to foil the tricks of his own trade).
<br><br><br><b style="color: #cc0000;">Voice Mimicry: <br></b><em>Slots: 2    Relevant Ability: Cha    Check Mod:</b></em> Special<br>Voice mimicry is the art of convincingly<br>imitating the voices of other people.<br>It is a very demanding skill, needing intensetraining<br>ofandpracticewith thevocal<br>cords. For this reason it requires two<br>nonweapon proficiency slots.<br><br>A character with voice mimicry is<br>able to imitate any accent he has heard.<br>Success is automatic unless people who<br>themselves speak in that accent are his<br>listeners; in such a case, a proficiency<br>roll is required (with a +2 modifier).<br><br>More difficult is the imitation of a specific<br>person's voice. To do this, the thief<br>must, of course, be familiar with the<br>voice. A proficiency check is needed to<br>determine if the imitation is detected;<br>modifiers depend on how well the listeners<br>know the voice that is being mimicked.<br>Success is of course certain if the<br>listener is a stranger, someone who has<br>never heard the original voice. To fool<br>an acquaintance, there is no modifier;<br>while fooling a friend of the subject is at<br>- 2, a close friend - 5, and someone extremely<br>close (e.g., parent or spousesomeone<br>who has had close contact with<br>the person for years) is at - 7.<br><br>This ability is often used in conjunction<br>with the disguise proficiency.<br>Which proficiency must be checked<br>first depends on whether the character<br>is seen or heard. If the disguise first is<br>successful, there is a +5 modifier to the<br>voice mimicry-the listeners have already<br>accepted the appearance, so they<br>are less likely to doubt the voice. If the<br>disguise fails, it doesn't matter how<br>eood the voice imitation is. If the voice ~<br>is successfully mimicked first, it gives a<br>+1 modifier to the disguise check.
