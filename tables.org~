* D&D Tables
This is a list of tables which will be useful to any Dungeon Master who is running a campaign in 2e AD&D.
Not included here is a list of items and prices. Such a list can be found at josephvadella.com/dnd/
Also not included are tables for weather generation. There is a tool available by s0py on github that will generate
all of the necessary weather attributes completely consistent with the Wilderness Survival Guide.
This webpage serves as a quick reference for any dungeon master who has these tools already and needs to
referrence other information.

* Food Spoilage
  The Number on the left is how many days there are between checks, the number on the right is the chance of the food spoiling.

* Temperature Damage to Characters
Now this is fun. A nice objective and nuanced way of dealing damage from exposure.
To use this, find the appropriate row for effective temperature of the person.
Go to the relevant set of columns depending on whether the character is protected
or unprotected.
If there is a number listed under Con, they must make a roll with that modifier and if they fail, they take the amount of damage.
To calculate the damage, take the number indicated in the Dmg column as the size die to roll.
If the damage would equal MORE THAN 10% of the character's CURRENT hit points, they take 10% instead.
| Personal Eff Temp | Unprotected Con | Dmg | Protected Con | Dmg |
|-------------------+-----------------+-----+---------------+-----|
| -60 or less       |             +14 |   8 |            +9 |   4 |

** Frostbite
 When a chracter takes damage from the cold and the temp is 0 or less
 and their extremities are not properly covered, they might develop frostbite.
 Damage is dealt first to these extremities but still counts toward your total hitpoints.
 A point of damage to your ear is still a point of damage to you.
 | Body Parts Exposed | Damage Distribution | Damage until Frostbitten |
 |--------------------+---------------------+--------------------------|
 | Just Feet          |                 all | 4 pts.                   |
 | Just Ears          |                 all | 6 pts                    |
 | Just Hands         |                 all | 8 pts                    |

* Visibility Range
At the given distance, the viewer can discern a M sized object on a flat horizon which is not trying to stay hidden.
Double for L sized objects, halve for S.

* Food & Water
** Lack of Food
Once beyond this tolerance level, make a Str or Con check (player's choice).
Each subsequent check after the first has an addition +1 penalty.
If a character fails the first, they are distressed an suffer an additional +1
If a character fails the second, they are distressed and suffer an additional +2
When they fail the third check, they are hours from death.

| Str + Con  | Tolerance |
|------------+-----------|
| 15 or less | 4 days    |
| 16 to 19   | 5 days    |
| 20 to 24   | 6 days    |
| 25 to 30   | 7 days    |
| 31 to 25   | 8 days    |
| 36+        | 10 days   |

Weakened: -1/day on all attack rolls and saving throws to dodging/reacting
Distressed: weakened effects + Con check on strenuous actitivy or become exhausted. Must make a successful Con check to remove Distress.
Incapacitated: character is permenantley exhausted. Distressed + Weakened but all mods from them are -4. Two meals and a successful Con check to remove Incapacitation.

** Daily Min Water
Numbers are in pints for a M sized human.
Elves need only 3/4 of the number listed
Dwarves/Gnomes/Hobbits need 2/3 of the number listed.

| Activity Level | Temp < 50 | 50-70 | 71-90 | 90+ |
|----------------+-----------+-------+-------+-----|
| Inactive       |         5 |     6 |     7 |   8 |
| Light          |         6 |     7 |     8 |  10 |
| Moderate       |         8 |     9 |    10 |  12 |
| Heavy          |         9 |    10 |    12 |  16 |

A characters can go 3 days without water by default but there are modifiers
+2 if food eaten has high water content
+1 character weighs more than 200 pounds, or female, or does nothing strenuous
-1 if effective temp >90 , or character doesn't eat, or Str <8, or Con <8

When tolerance is exceded, do the same for lack of food.
