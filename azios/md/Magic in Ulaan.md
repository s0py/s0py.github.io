# Magic in Ulaan

In [[Ulaan]], **Magic** is performed using air. The densities and motions of pockets of air in the larger atmos are the sigils which create effects. 

To be a magician in Ulaan means being able to read wind currents, predict where they will flow, and learn how to adjust their flow to cause the desired shapes.

Magicians hear spend their days out in the wilderness where they watch the air currents of the vast grasslands, listen to the melodies produced by wind chimes, studying the shapes of the clouds, or feeling the gusts on their skin. Only by modifying these eddies can magic be cast and the magicians learn which shapes and melodies cause which effects through these processes. 

They way a spell is cast can be as simple as playing a leitmotif to cause an immediate effect, or by carefully adding perturbations to the general wind flow to cause a giant swirl miles long. Getting a flap of a butterflies wings at just the right moment in just the right place can allow for a wind sigil the size of a city to be created.
