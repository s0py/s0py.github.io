**Oon Carolis** is an aspiring autocrat and the villain of the *[[Politics and the Pauper]]* novella that was released in 2016. 

## Life
Oon Carolis was born during a [[Cataclysm]] sixty years before the events of the Politics and the Pauper novella. He spent his early years as a fisherman off the coast of [[Ethqmir]], where he was known as the best in his village. Showing a talent for leveraging his fishing skills over other members of his village, Oon was noticed by a traveling talent hunter who was seeking to be the mind behind Ethqmir’s next political upstart. Oon was approached by the talent hunter and was given an offer by the man to come to the capital city of Lakefalls, which Oon accepted.

Years later Oon had grown into a maelstrom of charisma and had the talent hunter killed as he no longer needed the man. It was around this time that Oon became aware of and started experimenting with necromancy. 

By the time of Politics and the Pauper Oon had become proficient in using necromancy and had used it to absorb the charisma of dead rivals, thus allowing him to become a serious force in the turbulent world of Ethqmiri politics.

Despite being surrounded by his cohort of guard Golems at all times Oon Carolis died one day before the elections due to a stroke, thus resolving the conflict of the novella.

## Afterlife
Never one to let something as trivial as death keep him down, Oon Carolis, aware of his family history of strokes had a backup plan. After his death, the would-be autocrat was revived as a light ghost by his followers, by shining light through his soul-sack and not splitting it. 

Active once again in the world of politics, Oon Carolis is only held back now by small problems such as being unable to understand or record new information and being unaware of what time or day it is.

## Trivia
Oon Carolis was based on 2016 presidential candidate Martin O’Malley who the author was convinced would become an unstoppable tyrant if elected, which is why Modest Himpson so vocally supported Joe Biden in the 2016 race.
