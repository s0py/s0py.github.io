# Souls
Unlike in many mythologies, souls in [Azios](Azios Map.html) are a physical, sack-like organ in the chest cavity, opposite the heart. Souls hold all mental pathways and connections that make a person who they are and unlike other orgrans, they develop over one's lifetime. They do not store memory or muscle memory.

## Death
When a person dies their soul sack crystallizes. It is at this point that the soul can most easily be used for magic. Personality traits can be separated out by light emitted by shining light through the crystal
