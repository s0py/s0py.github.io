**Cateclist** is an escaped [[Vat Born]] soldier from the [[Four Cities]], who currently resides in the [[Tea Lands]]. He carries a lightning launcher that he took with him during his escape.

## Early Life
Cateclist was created as a Vat Born in the city of Wrei to serve as a foot soldier in the war against the Far Lands. He fought on the front lines for several months before he and fifteen other Vat Born soldiers became separated from the rest of the army by a terrible storm while out scouting.

As they were trying to find there way back to their dwellings after the storm the group came across a Far Lander ritual, and engaged the participants in combat. Only Cateclist survived this ordeal, and now for the first time found himself alone, and without pressure to return to the war. He collected the valuables of the deceased Far Landers and left the site of the battle.

He fled northwards into [[Yartzland]] and paid for a ship to the nearby [[Featherscale Isles]], where he stayed for a time making money both a laborer and a performer, before he saved enough money to once again travel to the Tea Lands.

## The Expedition
Cateclist has found himself under the employ of a group of scholars in the Tea Lands who seek to travel the world of Azios via airship and catalouge the various cultures and magics. Cateclist is a member of the security team of the voyage.
