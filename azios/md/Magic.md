# Magic
In the [World of the Morning Star](Azios), **magic** is the name given to any system in which the general laws of thermodynamics can be overcome in seemingly impossible ways. This could be in the spontaneous ordering of matter, conservation of mass or energy being violated, or by improbable events being the most common outcome (entropy reversal).

All magic is inherently physical in this sense, and all systems of magic rely on materials. The various landscapes, climates, and particulars of each location on Azios have led to various incompatible magic systems being developed. A list of them is provided below.
