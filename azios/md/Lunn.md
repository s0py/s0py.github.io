![The city of Lunn. In the center stands the ancient semi-ruined temple from the Ashen Empire's colonial project and the many tarped shacks surround it.](lunn.jpeg)
**Lunn** is a city on the northern coast of [[Ulaan]]. It was originally founded as a colonial outpost of the [[Ashen Empire]] before the [[Cataclysm]] and the large stonework temple and administration buildings remain today. Much of the the city is made up shacks and raised tarps which spread from the central stonework temple into the grasslands. 

The few remaining practioners of ash magic reside in Lunn though most of the magic is wind.
