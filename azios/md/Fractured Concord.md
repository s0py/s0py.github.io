# The Fractured Concord
The **Fractured Concord** is an entity which exists in the [[Ashen Empire]].

## Notes
A conglomerate of soul crystals
Birthed from a ritual gone wrong
Exists in eternal torment, screaming out in agony
Golems that they created adorn it as a god and ‘protect’ it from anyone trying to enter The Ashen Empire
