# The Ashen Empire
![Old banner of The Ashen Empire from before the Cataclysm, preserved in a library in the Four Cities.](ashen_empire_banner.png)
Once the mightiest and earliest great military powers in the world of the morning star, the **Ashen Empire** was reduced to ruin after the [[Cataclysm]]. It is located on a peninsula in the far south west of Azios bordered by the lands of [[Salt and Silence]] to the west and north, the jungles of [[Skittering Wilder]] to the east, and the grasslands of [[Ulaan]] to the north east. At the tri-point of Ulaan, the lands of Salt and Silence, and the Ashen Empire stands [[Mightspire]].

## Physical Geography
The landscape is tattered and beaten. [[Golems]] roam the wastelands. Most water is poison, most soil is salted, and every structure ever wrought from the land now seems to be little more than precariously piled stacks of stone.
