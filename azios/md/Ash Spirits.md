# Ash Spirits
**Ash spirits** are entities that come into existence when summoned using [[Ash Magic]]. Their summoner can bound them into service either by bending them to their will or by working out a contract with the spirit. Ash spirits are capricious beings who delight at the suffering of mortal beings but have a special respect for those who can bind them.

Ash spirits commonly appear as skeletal beings made from burning ash but have been known to take other forms, though they are still always burning.

Ash Spirits develop personalities based on the means of their summoning and the strength of their respective spirits. Despite the variations that can occur all ash spirits have a taste for blood and pain and will try to respond positively to acts of violence committed in their name. 

## Classifications
Lesser ash spirits: Ash spirits that were created to accomplish minor tasks. They can either be bound to objects via blood rites or be dismissed once they have achieved their tasks.

**Greater ash spirits**: Ash spirits that are summoned via great acts of ash magic, these spirits have fully developed personalities and will rarely be immediately compliant with their summoners. Greater ash spirits can also be bound to objects via blood rites but will withhold their full powers from the item unless given continuous sacrifice.
