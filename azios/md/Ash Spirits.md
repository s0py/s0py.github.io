# Ash Spirits
**Ash spirits** are entities that come into existence when summoned using [[Ash Magic]]. Their summoner can bound them into service either by bending them to their will or by working out a contract with the spirit. Ash spirits are capricious beings who delight at the suffering of mortal beings but have a special respect for those who can bind them.

Ash spirits commonly appear as skeletal beings made from burning ash but have been known to take other forms, though they are still always burning.

Ash Spirits develop their personalities based on how they were summoned and by the scope of the summoning ritual. Despite the variations that can occur all ash spirits have a taste for blood and pain and will try to respond positively to acts of violence committed in their name. 

## Lesser Ash Spirits
Ash spirits were created to accomplish minor tasks. They can either be bound to objects via blood rites or be dismissed once they have achieved their tasks. In terms of intelligence, these spirits are mostly as smart as small animals but rarely can be as intelligent as young children.

**Ini**: small burning humanoid creatures that flit around the air on wings of smoke. Used as projectiles by summoners.

## Greater Ash Spirits
Ash spirits that are summoned via great acts of ash magic, these spirits have fully developed personalities and will rarely be immediately compliant with their summoners. These spirits are greatly intelligent, more so on average than even most scholars, and come into being with a vast understanding of their environments and abilities. Greater spirits can learn new skills quickly, and think themselves to be far above the mortals that have created them. Greater ash spirits can also be bound to objects via blood rites but will withhold their full powers from the item unless given continuous sacrifice.

It is very common for greater spirits to develop a predilection for specific types of sacrifice, and will in some cases, reject all others. 

## Notable Ash Spirits
**Mightspire**: The nameless soul of the [[Mightspire]] that provides the massive tower with stability despite its size.

**Ith’nicor**: Affectionately known by the [Far Landers](People of the Far Lands.html) as, the eater of heads, is a greater Ash Spirit that is frequently summoned in times of war. Ith’nicor is a master of music and will occasionally trade information about various sciences in exchange for a new melody or instrument.
