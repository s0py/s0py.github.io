# Ulaan
The only major permanent place in the entire grasslands is a holy site where all violence is forbidden. Even animal slaughter and surgery are done outside the city limits. The city originated as a colony from the Ashen Empire. The city has a mix of old, ruined buildings of higher quality made by masons whose skills are long forgotten. The rest of the city is mostly yurts and tents and covered hovels of impermanence. The tarps and tapestries are decorated with the beautiful patterns of all the various tribes and clans of the plains.

The plains are a very beautiful place. Plentiful are all good things which nature provides. Crops are quick to take root and grow healthy, but there is little permanence. Many large roaming bands of raiders and thieves and war machines ravage anything permanent so there are no large cities. Many of the common people have chosen to be herders so they can move quickly if rumors of a war party are over the horizon. 

The lands surrounding the grasslands are filled with giant insects in the [[Skittering Wilder]], horrible magic golems in the [[Ashen Empire]], and toxic noxious rocks and beasts of the lands of [[Salt and Silence]].

## Magic
*See [[Magic in Ulaan]]*
The main form of magic here is wind magic. Altho there are also a few remaining ashen priests and magi from the thousand year fallen Ashen Empire who practice obscure arts in the ruined temples, the most common form of magic is finding the melody in the cacophony. People will set up wind chimes to gather melodies and will spend hours listening and studying, trying to memorize motifs and progressions which they can then play on their own wind instruments to cast their spells and have magical effects.
