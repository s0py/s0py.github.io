# Golems
**Golems** are magical constructs with a humanoid appearance that are created through various magical means. They are usually created with a set number of instructions that imbued into them at creation.

## Necromantic Golems
Necromantic golems are dead matter that has been animated by splitting the aspects of a personâ€™s soul by using a prism on the light that has been shined through their soul sack and split into the aspects of their personality. The next step requires implanting the person's servileness and any other desired aspects into the matter. This will result in the creation of a necromantic golem.

Necromantic golems are commonly created from corpses as they are already humanoid in form and quickly available should the need arise.

## Ash Golems
Ash golems are created by using ash magic to create a humanoid servant. This requires a blood offering as all ash magic does as well as a skeleton that allows the golem to take shape. The skeleton of a golem is often created of either wood or metal, though a genuine bone skeleton works just as well and is known to be occasionally used. In fact, all golems that exist in the ruins of the Ashen Empire have real human bones as their skeletons.
