# Qthemir
**Qthemir** is a colony nation of [[Ethqmir]] that neighbors the [[Gangling Grove]] where the [[Okepfs]] live. The land of Qthemir is immensely fertile, and much of the population of the country is farmers or merchants.

The population of Qthemir is mostly made up of settlers who left Ethqmir of their own accord, but just like its parent country, the political class of Qthemir is an exception to the rule. Most of its political class is politicians who have chosen to self-exile themselves to Qthemir to pursue their ambitions free from their rivals in the homeland.

## Politics of Qthemir
Qthemir has yet to develop the deeply fractured political landscape of Ethqmir, though it is only a matter of time. Despite the lack of solid political parties Qthemirâ€™s landscape is just as turbulent with the title of Colony Governor being the grand prize.

## Physical Geography
Qthemir is connected to its parent country by four ancient stone bridges that were built by the now-destroyed Ashen Empire. 

Qthemir is a flat land filled with deep brown and incredibly fertile soil. Small towns spatter the countryside and there is a single major city located in the country's center that acts as the capital, though this city is still small by Ethqmiri standards.
