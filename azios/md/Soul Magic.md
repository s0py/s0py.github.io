# Soul Magic
-new personality traits or knowledge can be added to a person from the soul of a dead person
	-a soul can be altered by mages after death
-souls can be put into artificial bodies to create people tailor made to what the creator wants the person to do (Vat Born)
-liches
	-have artificial bodies that have a soul sack that their soul crystal is put inside of
	-they can form new memories and continue their life
	-when this body dies they have a larger soul crystal that requires a larger body
	-every time this happens the lich requires a larger body
-eventually liches figure out how to have their soul sack separate from their bodies connected by an umbilical cord
