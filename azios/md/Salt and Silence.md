# The Lands of Salt and Silence:
This is the big desert that is filled with horrible creatures. Every 49th year when [the ice falls](Fragrant Epocher.html), horrid demons wake.

## Souls:
-sack like organ near the heart
-holds all mental pathways and connections that make a person who they are, developed over their lifetime
	-does not keep memory or muscle memory
-when a person dies their soul sack crystalizes	
	-can now be used for magic
	-personality traits can be separated out by light emitted by shining light through the crystal
-what can be done with souls
-new personality traits or knowledge can be added to a person from the soul of a dead person
	-a soul can be altered by mages after death
-souls can be put into artificial bodies to create people tailor made to what the creator wants the person to do (Vat Born)
-liches
	-have artificial bodies that have a soul sack that their soul crystal is put inside of
	-they can form new memories and continue their life
	-when this body dies they have a larger soul crystal that requires a larger body
	-every time this happens the lich requires a larger body
-eventually liches figure out how to have their soul sack separate from their bodies connected by an umbilical cord
