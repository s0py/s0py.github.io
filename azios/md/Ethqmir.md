# Ethqmir
**Ethqmir** is a large nation on the western continent of Azios, and borders the [[United Baronies]] and the [[Goolands]]. Ethqmir is a wealthy nation that is constantly experiencing a state of political upheaval, but only at the highest levels of its society. The result of this is a relatively stable and peaceful life for all of its citizens, aside from its political class.

Ethqmir is also known as the Gate to the South by its northern neighbors as it controls access to [the old bridges](Bridges of Ethqmir) created by the [[Ashen Empire]] that connect the two continents. Partially as a result of this Ethqmir is convinced of its own critical importance to the goings on of the world at large, though this is largely a nationwide delusion.

## Physical Geography
Ethqmir is comprised of flatlands with sparse forests and two large lakes, one of which it shared with the United Baronies. The country ends at its southernmost point at a sheer drop of 500 feet into the ocean.

There are many towns and cities scattered throughout the country, each one with its flavor of political drama currently consuming the lives of its elites. 

Ethqmir is the steward of four ancient stone bridges that were constructed over two thousand years ago by the Ashen Empire as it marched northward. These brides connect two of Azios’ continents and lead to the colony-nation of Qthemir, a subjugation of Ethqmir. Qthemir was settled for two reasons, the first being the incredibly rich soil of the land next to the Gangling Grove, and the second being the lack of native inhabitants that would impede or prevent settlement.
