# Vat Born
**Vat Born** are a species of artificial humanoids created by the [Biomantic Industriomancers](Industriomancy.html) of the [[Four Cities]]. They were created to serve the functions of soldiers and battlefield commanders in the wars of the Four Cities, as well as household servants within the cities.

## Appearance

There are several commonalities among each of the three types of Vat Born. All Vat born are hairless humanoid beings with skin entirely comprised of one solid color, with the colors being red, green, and blue. Vat Born have large pointed ears, and stand around six feet tall.
### Red
Red skinned Vat Born are soldiers, and are the most populace form of the Vat Born. They are physically stronger than the other two varieties and come pre-programmed with the muscle memory for basic combat maneuvers. They all wear basic bronze armor that is provided to them at their birth and most commonly wield blunt staves as weapons.
### Green
Green Skinned Vat Born are servants and go-betweens for their masters with in the cities. They are the least capable in combat, but are the most sociable of all three varieties as they have been created to be excellent speakers, and caretakers. They are dressed in fine clothes that are provided to them by their masters as a way for their masters to show of their status and wealth.
### Blue
Blue skinned Vat Born are slender and coldly intelligent. They are given obsessive personalities  by their creators, and then handed two incredibly complicated and powerful pieces of technology that will inevitably become the focus point of their obsessions. They act of the commanders of the Vat Born soldiers and often wear entirely black clothing that they have customized to fit their specific tastes.

## Creation
Vat Born are created through a process of recycling flesh. This flesh was originally spruced from the recently deceased of the cities but was later one sourced from dead Vat Born, as it can be used ad nauseum, and from new donors mostly in the form of [Far Landers](People of the Far Lands.html) killed in their war with the Four Cities. 

Key to the process of creating a Vat Born is the extraction of crystallized [soul](Soul.html) sacks which replaced into an empty cavity in the Vat Bornâ€™s chest, very similarly to the process that liches use. Though the difference is that the information that is allowed to travel from the soul sack to the brain is greatly reduced in the Vat Born, with only basic concepts such as motor functions and the ability to speak being allowed into the brain.
