# Witnesses
A **Witness** is a small mammal resembling a sphere of long fur. They have a single monolithic eye in the front-center of their body and locomote on 12 legs which are hidden by their long fur. Witnesses receive great joy from following other creatures around--most typically humans--and watching them. It seems like they have evolved to have this behavior tho it is unclear what advantage they receive from this behavior.

## Biology
Witnesses are highly resilient creatures and can survive in any environment on Azios. A witness in an arctic will have the same amount of fur as one that lives in a tropical environment, If a witness if moved from one of these two extremes to another however it will quickly die. When a witness is killed it will explode into a puff of black fur, leaving no traces of its other body parts.

Witnesses are omnivores and are opportunistic hunters. They will eat anything that they can fit into their mouths, which are located between their four legs at the lower center of their bodies.

Witnesses reproduce asexually.

## In Societies
Since witnesses are everywhere on Azios all societies have a relationship of some kind with them. These relationships range from ambivalence to adoration, with witnesses being massively popular pets in the Holy Empire of Yama.

## Trivia
[[Modest Himpson]] created witnesses based on the behavior of his dog.

Many witnesses are kept as pets and companions across Azios.
